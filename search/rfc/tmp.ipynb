MSML dialogs are executed independently from the MSML core context.   When an MSML dialog is started, MSML allocates the dialog control   resources, and if successful, starts those resources executing.  MSML   core execution then continues without waiting for the MSML dialog to   complete.  This forking of MSML dialog invocation from the MSML core   context is done via the <dialogstart> element.  Media streams are   created between the MSML dialog target and other internal media   server resources as part of dialog execution.  Stream creation is   subject to the requirements defined in the MSML Core Package and   media streams as defined by the MSML Conference Core Package.\n",

Status events are requested by including one or more status request   elements.  These elements correspond to different stages or events in   fax operation and cause predefined events to be sent to the invoking   environment when they occur.  Since the only recipient of these   events is expected to be a fax control agent, requests are simplified   by associating a predefined namelist of shadow variables with each   event.  This decision may be revisited to allowed tailored namelists   based on further implementation experience.  Status requests apply   both to sending and polling operation.\n",

Alternatively, a control channel could already have been established   that was used for all CA/MS interactions.  A control channel per   conference is only one possible model.  Currently, MSML uses SIP INFO   requests and responses on this SIP dialog.  There is a proposal to   use this message exchange to establish a TCP channel for MSML similar   to the approach used for the Media Resource Control Protocol v2   (MRCPv2).  This approach would require that a request identifier be   added to the <msml> element to correlate requests and responses.   This currently relies on the SIP INFO request and response for this   property.  MSML messages are shown without specifying the transport   in this example, but it assumes a request/response correlation based   on transport messages.\n",

This sources   and sinks media and uses voice activity DTMF detection and   recognition to influence behavior.  Any DTMF input or voice activity   will barge the play and cause the record to begin.  However, if the   prompt was barged with a DTMF digit of '#', the record terminates   without starting.  When the play terminates, it send a starttimer   event to the VAD to allow it to recognize an initial silence   condition.  The recording will be terminated (without starting) when   the VAD detects an initial 3 seconds of silence.\n",

It will terminate after 5   seconds of silence or after 60 seconds elapses.  It will also   terminate if a '#' key is recognized.

       " 'Abstract. The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and invoke many different types of services on IP media servers. The MSML control interface was initially driven by RadiSys with subsequent significant contributions from Intel, Dialogic, and others in the industry. Clients can use it to define how multimedia sessions interact on a media server and to apply services to individuals or groups of users. MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams. As well, clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences. Transformation of media streams to and from users or conferences as well as interactive voice response (IVR) dialogs are examples of such interactions, which are specified using MSML. MSML clients may also invoke dialogs with individual users or with groups of conference participants using VoiceXML.',\n",

Control agents and other users of media servers (called media server clients) can define and create many different services based on how they configure and use those resources. Often, that configuration and the ways in which those resources interact will be changed dynamically over the course of a call, to reflect changes in the way that an application interacts with a user.',\n",
       " 'Introduction. For example, a call may undergo an initial IVR dialog before being placed into a conference. Calls may be moved from a main conference to a sidebar conference and then back again. Individual calls may be directly bridged to create small n-way calls or simple sidebars.

MSML is used to define and change the service that a user connected to a media server will receive.

       " 'MSML SIP Usage. MSML transactions are originated based upon events that occur in the application domain. These events may be independent from any media or user interaction. For example, an application may wish to play an announcement to a conference warning that its scheduled completion time is approaching. Applications themselves are structured in many different ways. Their structure and requirements contribute to their selection of protocols and languages. To accommodate differing application needs, MSML has been designed to be neutral to other languages and independent of the transport used to carry it.',\n",

In addition, there are existing widely deployed implementations of that method, it aids in initial developments that are closely coupled with SIP session establishment, and it allows MSML to be directly associated with user dialogs when third party call control is used.',\n",
       " 'SIP INFO. Although INFO is sometimes considered not to be a suitable general- purpose transport mechanism for messages within SIP, there have been proposals to make it more acceptable. MSML may evolve to include other SIP usage and/or to work with other protocols or as a stand- alone protocol established through SIP, in future releases of this document.',\n",
       " 'SIP INFO. MSML supports several models for client interaction. When clients use 3PCC to establish media sessions on behalf of end users, clients will have a SIP dialog for each media session. MSML MAY be sent on these dialogs. However the targets of MSML actions are not inferred from the session associated with the SIP dialog. The targets of MSML actions are always explicitly specified using identifiers as previously defined.',\n",
       " 'SIP INFO. An application, after interacting with a user, may want to affect multiple objects within a media server. For example, tones or messages are often played to a conference when connections are added or removed. A separate message may also be played to a participant as they are joined, or to moderators. Explicit identifiers, that is, not inferred from a transport mechanism, allow these multiple actions to be easily grouped into a single transaction sent on any SIP dialog.',\n",
       " 'SIP INFO. MSML also supports a model of dedicated control associations. This supports decoupled application architectures where a client can control media server services without also establishing all of the media sessions itself. Control associations are created using SIP, but they do not have any associated media session. Although initially INFO messages will be sent on this SIP dialog, just as with dialogs associated with media sessions, it is possible that in the future, the SIP dialog will be used to establish a separate control session (defined in SDP [n9]) that does not use SIP as the transport for MSML messages.',\n",
       " 'SIP INFO. A media server using MSML also sends asynchronous events to a client using MSML scripts in SIP INFO.

Status events are requested by including one or more status request elements. These elements correspond to different stages or events in fax operation and cause predefined events to be sent to the invoking environment when they occur. Since the only recipient of these events is expected to be a fax control agent, requests are simplified by associating a predefined namelist of shadow variables with each event. This decision may be revisited to allowed tailored namelists based on further implementation experience. Status requests apply both to sending and polling operation.',\n",

They show the relationship between SIP signaling to establish media sessions and MSML service control commands. For brevity, only the content of MSML messages is shown. The examples assumes that the CA and MS use the IPv4 address and UDP port number of the audio stream (on the MS) to identify the MSML connection.',\n",

Alternatively, a control channel could already have been established that was used for all CA/MS interactions. A control channel per conference is only one possible model. Currently, MSML uses SIP INFO requests and responses on this SIP dialog. There is a proposal to use this message exchange to establish a TCP channel for MSML similar to the approach used for the Media Resource Control Protocol v2 (MRCPv2). This approach would require that a request identifier be added to the <msml> element to correlate requests and responses. This currently relies on the SIP INFO request and response for this property. MSML messages are shown without specifying the transport in this example, but it assumes a request/response correlation based on transport messages.',\n",
