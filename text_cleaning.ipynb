Definitions:     * \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.   * \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.   * \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.   * \"You\" is you, if you’re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.   * \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)   * \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.      1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:     6 Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.2.1 Available under license :  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names  do not conflict with standard executables, which  must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in  object code or executable form, provided that you  do at least ONE of the following:     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this P  ackage do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.    7.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  Version 2, June 1991  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to tak  e away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software   9 Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors’ reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any   10  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each li  censee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License  along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion   11  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third  parties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program norm  ally reads commands interactively  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a  notice that there is no warranty (  or else, saying that you provide  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under  these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but  does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered ind  ependent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.   12  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections  1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete  machine-readable copy of the co  rresponding source code, to be  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  customarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer  to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you  received the program in object code or executable form with such  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code d  istributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.   13  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses  terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of  this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this   14  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distrib  ution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in r  eliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to   15  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software w  hich is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO W  ARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AR  ISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED   16  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or  (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the  GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  Also add information on how to contact you b  y electronic and paper mail.   17  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author  Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w’.  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  under certain conditions; type `show c’ for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w’ and `show c’ should show the appropriate  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may  be called something other than `show w’ and `show c’; they could even be  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary.

If your program is a subroutine library, you may  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the  library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General  Public License instead of this License.   18  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.4 GNU Nano Editor 2.0.1  1.4 GNU Nano Editor 2.0.1  1.4.1 Available under license :  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   Version 2, June 1991     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floo  r, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

The \"\"Program\"\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"\"work based on the Program\"\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing th  e Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another  language.

Preamble     The licenses for most software are designed to tak  e away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.     When we speak of free software, we are referri  ng to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether   22  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and/or modify the software.     Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified  by someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors’ reputations.     Finally, any free program is threat  ened constantly by software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we ha  ve made it clear that any  patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.     The precise terms and conditions f  or copying, distribution and  modification follow.     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing th  e Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".     23  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License  along with the Program.    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet  all of these conditions:     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third   parties under the terms of this License.     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a   notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this   24  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but   does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on   the Program is not required to print an announcement.)    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered ind  ependent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.    In addition, mere aggregation of anoth  er work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your   cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete   machine-readable copy of the co  rresponding source code, to be   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium   customarily used for software interchange; or,   25  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer   to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   received the program in object c  ode or executable form with such   an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)    The source code for a work means the preferred form of  the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source co  de for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code distributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code fro  m the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses  terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.     5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and   26  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of  the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.    If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distrib  ution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot   27  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  impose that choice.    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.     8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original copyright holder who places th  e Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such cas  e, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.     10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software w  hich is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     NO WARRANTY     11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN   28  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE  LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES A  RISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistri  bute and change under these terms.     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     <one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify   29  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or   (at your option) any later version.     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the   GNU General Public License for more details.     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License   along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software   Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.    Also add information on how to contact you b  y electronic and paper mail.    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ’show w’.   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it   under certain conditions; type ’show c’ for details.    The hypothetical commands ’show w’ and ’show c’ should show the appropriate  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may  be called something other than ’show w’ and ’  show c’; they could even be  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program   ’Gnomovision’ (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.     <signature of Ty Coon> , 1 April 1989   Ty Coon, President of Vice     30  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into  proprietary programs.

Preamble     The licenses for most software are design  ed to take away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.   37  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give the reci  pients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and/or modify the software.     Also, for each author’s p  rotection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified b  y someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors’ reputations.     Finally, any free program is threatened constantly b  y software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any  patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,   38  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a cop  y of this License  along with the Program.    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet  all of these conditions:     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third   parties under the terms of this License.     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an   39  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a   notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this   License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but   does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on   the Program is not required to print an announcement.)    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered ind  ependent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and every part re  gardless of who wrote it.    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.    In addition, mere aggregation of anoth  er work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your   40  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium   customarily used for soft  ware interchange; or,     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer   to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   received the program in object code or executable form with such   an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code d  istributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable ru  ns, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source alon  g with the object code.     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.     5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or   41  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or an  y work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of  the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.    If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. M  any people have made   42  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  impose that choice.    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.     8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original copyright holder wh  o places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.     10. If you wish to incorporate parts of t  he Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     43  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  NO WARRANTY     11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES A  RISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH H  OLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistrib  ute and change under these terms.     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     44  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  <one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify   it under the terms of the GNU General P  ublic License as published by   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or   (at your option) any later version.     This program is distributed in t  he hope that it will be useful,   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the   GNU General Public License for more details.     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along   with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ’show w’.   This is free software, and you are w  elcome to redistribute it   under certain conditions; type ’show c’ for details.    The hypothetical commands ’show w’ and ’show c’ should show the appropriate  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may  be called something other than ’show w’ and ’show c’; they could even be  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program   ’Gnomovision’ (which makes passes at co  mpilers) written by James Hacker.   45  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :    <signature of Ty Coon> , 1 April 1989   Ty Coon, President of Vice    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into  proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the  library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  Public License instead of this License.   46  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10 Mindspeed Firmware Loader for TSP3 Chip Unknown  1.10 Mindspeed Firmware Loader for TSP3 Chip Unknown  1.10.1 Available under license :  Code is provided by a vendor, Mindspeed.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   Version 2, June 1991     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     Preamble     The licenses for most software are designed to tak  e away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.     When we speak of free software, we are referri  ng to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate t  o certain responsibilities for you if you   47  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and/or modify the software.     Also, for each author’s p  rotection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors’ reputations.     Finally, any free program is threat  ened constantly by software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we ha  ve made it clear that any  patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another   48  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".

Definitions:    \"Package\" refers to the collection  of files distributed by the  Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files  created through textual modification.    \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been  modified, or has been modified in ac  cordance with the wishes  of the Copyright Holder as specified below.    \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or  copyrights for the package.    \"You\" is you, if you’re thinking about copying or distributing  this Package.    \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the  basis of media cost, duplication charge  s, time of people involved,  and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the  Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large  as a market that must bear the fee.)     62  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item  itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it  under the same conditions they received it.    1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the  Standard Version of this Package witho  ut restriction, provided that you  duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications  derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package  modified in such a way shall still be conside  red the Standard Version.    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and  when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the  following:     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them   Freely Available, such as by post  ing said modifications to Usenet or   an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive   site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include   your modifications in the Standa  rd Version of the Package.     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict   with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide   a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly   documents how it differs from the Standard Version.     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or  executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,   together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where   63  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  to get the Standard Version.     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of   the Package with your modifications.     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly   document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together   with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this  Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this  Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,  you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly  commercial) programs as part of a lar  ger (possibly commercial) software  distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a  product of your own. You may embed this Package’s interpreter within  an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere  form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the  interpreter is so embedded.    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as  output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall  under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated  them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this  Package. If such scripts or librar  y files are aggregated with this  Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a  binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall  neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it  fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do  not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this  Package.    7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other  languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to  emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this  Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the   64  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do  not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the  regression tests for the language.    8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always  permitted provided that the use of t  his Package is embedded; that is,  when no overt attempt is made to make this Package’s interfaces visible  to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be  construed as a distribution of this Package.    9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.    10.

The End  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   Version 1, February 1989     Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.   59 Temple Place, Suite 330, B  oston, MA 02111-1307, USA   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     Preamble     The license agreements o  f most software companies try to keep users  at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The  General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation’s  software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  You can use it for your programs, too.     When we speak of free software, we are referri  ng to freedom, not  price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make   65  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free  software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,  that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free  programs; and that you know you can do these things.     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give t  he recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must tell them their rights.     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and/or modify the software.     Also, for each author’  s protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified b  y someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors’ reputations.     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be  distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The  \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based  on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the   66  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each  licensee is addressed as \"you\".     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this  General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any  other recipients of the Program a cop  y of this General Public License  along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of  transferring a copy.     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of  it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph  1 above, provided that you also do the following:     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that   you changed the files and the date of any change; and     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that   in whole or in part contains the Program or an  y part thereof, either   with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all   third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except   that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all   third parties, at your option).     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when   run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use   in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice   that there is no warranty (or else, sayin  g that you provide a   warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these   conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General   Public License.     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a   copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in   exchange for a fee.   67  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its  derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring  the other work under the scope of these terms.       3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of  it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     a) accompany it with the compl  ete corresponding machine-readable   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge   for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the   corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,     c) accompany it with the informa  tion you received as to where the   corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   received the program in object code or executable form alone.)    Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making  modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means  all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special  exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard  libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable  file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that  accompany that operating system.     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the  Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer  the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use  the Program under this License. However, parties who have received   68  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties  remain in full compliance.     5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based  on the Program) you indicate your accept  ance of this license to do so,  and all its terms and conditions.     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original  licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these  terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the  recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein.       7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of the lice  nse which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.     8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     NO WARRANTY     69  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE  LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DA  MAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES A  RISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH H  OLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these  terms.     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to  attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey  the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the  \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     70  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  <one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify   it under the terms of the GNU General P  ublic License as published by   the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)   any later version.     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the   GNU General Public License for more details.     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License   along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,   Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.    Also add information on how to contact you b  y electronic and paper mail.    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ’show w’.   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it   under certain conditions; type ’show c’ for details.    The hypothetical commands ’show w’ and ’show c’ should show the  appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the  commands you use may be called something other than ’show w’ and ’show  c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your  program.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE  ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting  Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands  as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python’s  principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for  National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see htt  p://www.cnri.reston.va.us)  in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the  software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to  BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same  year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (see  http://www.digicool.com). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation  (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit  organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual  Property. Digital Creations is a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for  the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python  releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes  the various releases.  Release Derived Year Owner GPL-  from compatible?

All Python licenses, un  like the GPL, let you distribute  a modified version without making your changes open source. The  GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with  other software that is released under the GPL; the others don’t.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido’s  direction to make these releases possible.  B.

Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to tak  e away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,   80  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  distribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors’ reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we ha  ve made it clear that any  patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.   81  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License  along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third  parties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program norm  ally reads commands interactively  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a  notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under  these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but  does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in   82  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and e  very part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of anoth  er work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections  1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete  machine-readable copy of the co  rresponding source code, to be  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  customarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer  to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you  received the program in object code or executable form with such  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)   83  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code d  istributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source along with the  object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses  terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further   84  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the   85  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software w  hich is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,   86  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AR  ISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or  (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the   87  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  Also add information on how to contact you b  y electronic and paper mail.  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author  Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w’.  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  under certain conditions; type `show c’ for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w’ and `show c’ should show the appropriate  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may  be called something other than `show w’ and `show c’; they could even be  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program  `Gnomovision’ (which makes passes at co  mpilers) written by James Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon> , 1 April 1989  Ty Coon, President of Vice  This General Public License does not permit  incorporating your program into  proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the  library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General  Public License instead of this License.   88  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  For further information, contact:  John Pawling, John.Pawling@DigitalNet.com  DigitalNet, LLC  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   89  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.17 TAO/ACE ORB 1.2a  1.17 TAO/ACE ORB 1.2a  1.17.1 Available under license :  Copyright and Licensing Information for ACE(TM), TAO(TM), and CIAO(TM)  [1]ACE(TM), [2]TAO(TM) and [3]CIAO(TM) are copyrighted by [4]Douglas C.

overall management of the meeting. The meeting window provides a forum for you to manage all aspects of the meeting and enable participants to chat, send video, share information and interact with each other via documents, presentations, whiteboards, applications, and more.  Some of the most common tasks that you can perform as host are described below:    \\uf0a7 Edit your welcome message (on page 17)  \\uf0a7 Record the meeting (on page 4)  \\uf0a7 Invite more people (on page 5)  \\uf0a7 Remind invitees to join (on page 10)  \\uf0a7 Change presenters (on page 11)  \\uf0a7 Make someone else the host (on page 14)  \\uf0a7 Send a transcript (on page 19)  \\uf0a7 End the meeting (on page 20).  A host can often be a presenter. For instructions on presenting information, see Sharing Files and Whiteboards (on page 217) and Sharing Software (on page 243).  Hosting and Managing a Meeting   Chapter 1: Hosting and Managing a Meeting    2      Note: For a more in-depth understanding of how to navigate the meeting window, go to A quick tour of the meeting window (on page 21).

If another user has granted scheduling permission to you in his or her user profile, you can schedule a meeting on behalf of that user. For details about granting scheduling permission to another user, see Allowing another user to schedule meetings for you (on page 138).  Note: If you use Microsoft Outlook 2000 or a later version, you can schedule, start, and join an online meeting using Outlook. For instructions on using Integration to Outlook, refer the Integration to Outlook User\\'s Guide, which is available on your Meeting Center Web site.   Chapter 5: Scheduling a Meeting    92      Choosing a level of security for a scheduled meeting When scheduling a meeting, you can provide security for the meeting using these means:  \\uf0a7 Require a password: Attendees must provide the password you set before joining the meeting. For more information, see About the Required Information page.  \\uf0a7 Decline to list this meeting on the meeting calendar: An unlisted meeting does not appear in the meeting calendar on the Browse Meetings page or on your Personal Meetings page. To join an unlisted meeting, attendees must provide a unique meeting number. For more information, see About the Required Information page.  \\uf0a7 Exclude the meeting password from email invitations: If you invite attendees to a meeting, you can prevent the password from appearing in the email invitations that your Meeting Center Web site sends automatically to attendees. For details, see About the Required Information page.  \\uf0a7 Require attendees to log in: You can require attendees to have a user account on your Meeting Center Web site to join the meeting. Thus, attendees must log in to your site before they can attend the meeting. For more information, see About the Invite Attendees page.  \\uf0a7 Require attendees to register for the meeting: If you require each attendee to send a registration request to you before joining a meeting, you can accept or reject each registration request. For more information, see About the Registration page (on page 113).    Tip: Choose a level of security based on the meeting\\'s purpose. For example, if you schedule a meeting to discuss your company picnic, you probably need to set only a password for the meeting.

Meeting password  Confirm password  Require participants to enter the password you set to join your meeting.  Your site may require that all passwords comply with security criteria, such as a minimum length and a minimum number of letters, numbers or special characters. A password:  \\uf0a7 Can contain a maximum of 16 characters.  \\uf0a7 Cannot contain spaces or any of the following characters: \\\\ ` “ / & < > == [ ]  Each participant that you invite to your meeting receives an invitation email message that includes the password, unless you request that passwords do not appear in email invitations.  If you have selected Personal Conference as the meeting type, the default password is the attendee access code in your Personal Conference number account that is specified for the meeting.  Tracking codes Identify your department, project, or other information that your organization wants to associate with your meetings. Tracking codes can be optional or required, depending on how your site administrator set them up.

This is an optional feature that must be enabled by your site administrator.        Chapter 5: Scheduling a Meeting    99    Questions about required information for setting up a meeting  Why set up an unlisted meeting?  You can prevent a scheduled meeting from appearing on the meeting calendar and any other publicly accessible pages on your Meeting Center Web site, by setting up an unlisted meeting. If a meeting is unlisted, the meeting details, such as its host, topic, and starting time are not available on the calendar and other places. This additional security may help prevent unauthorized access to the meeting.  To join an unlisted meeting, a participant must provide a unique meeting number.  If you invite a participant to an unlisted meeting, the participant receives an invitation email message that includes complete instructions for joining the meeting-including the meeting number-and a URL that links directly to a Web page on which the participant can join the meeting.  What are tracking codes?  Your site administrator can include tracking codes in the Advanced Scheduler. Tracking codes may identify your department, project, or other information that your organization wants to associate with your meeting. Tracking codes can be optional or required, depending on how your site administrator sets them up.  How can I learn more about the fields on the Required Information page?

You can set the time a scheduled meeting starts and the meeting\\'s estimated duration. This information allows attendees to reserve the appropriate length of time in their schedules. The meeting does not end automatically after the duration you set.  What happens if I allow participants to join the meeting before the start time?  Participants can see the agenda and other details about the meeting. You can also set up a presentation to inform or entertain the participants while they wait for the meeting to start.

The number to call automatically appears in a message box when a participant joins a meeting. If your meeting service provides toll-free call-in teleconferencing, both a toll-free number and a toll number are available. The global call-in option provides a list of numbers-such as toll-free or local numbers-that attendees in other countries can call to join the teleconference.  \\uf0a7 Integrated call-back teleconference-A teleconference that a participant can join by providing his or her phone number when joining a meeting. The participant enters his or her number in a dialog box that appears when he or she joins the meeting. The teleconferencing service calls the participant at the number he or she provided.    Chapter 5: Scheduling a Meeting    107    \\uf0a7 If your site includes the international call-back option, participants in other countries can receive a call back. For more information about this option, ask your meeting service site administrator.  \\uf0a7 Third-party or internal teleconference-Any teleconferencing service other than the integrated teleconferencing service. You can use any third-party teleconferencing service or internal teleconferencing system, and provide instructions for joining teleconference when setting up a meeting. Your instructions automatically appear in a message box when a participant joins the meeting.  What are the system requirements for VoIP?  To use VoIP, ensure that your computer meets the following system requirements:  \\uf0a7 A supported sound card  For a current list of supported sound cards, refer to the Frequently Asked Questions page on your Meeting Center Web site. You can access this page from your site\\'s Support page.  \\uf0a7 Speakers or headphones  \\uf0a7 Microphone, if you want to speak during the conference  Tip: For better audio quality and greater convenience, use a computer headset with a high-quality microphone.  When should I include VoIP?  \\uf0a7 Your meeting includes remote attendees who do not want to be charged for long-distance phone calls.  \\uf0a7 Your meeting will not involve much interaction-for example, attendees will listen to a presentation instead of engage in a discussion.  \\uf0a7 You want to minimize the voice conferencing costs for the meeting.  Check that your computer has the minimum system requirements for VoIP. For details, see About the Audio Conference Settings page (on page 103).  What is a dual-mode voice conference and when should I use it?  You can set up a dual-mode voice conference for a scheduled or instant meeting-that is, a voice conference that includes both a teleconference and VoIP. In a dual-mode voice conference, participants can use either type of service.   Chapter 5: Scheduling a Meeting    108    In a dual-mode voice conference, a participant can listen to audio using either a phone or speakers attached to his or her computer. To speak, a participant can use either a phone or microphone attached to his or her computer.  Note: \\uf0a7 Participants in a teleconference can speak to and hear only other participants in the teleconference. Similarly, participants using VoIP can speak to and hear only other participants using VoIP. Thus, the dual-mode conference option is usually appropriate for a  meeting in which participants will listen to a presentation only and not interact in the voice conference. \\uf0a7 All participants can listen to a presentation if the presenter speaks into both a phone and a microphone.

When inviting attendees to a scheduled meeting, you can designate one or more attendees as alternate hosts for the meeting. An alternate host can start the meeting and act as the host. Thus, an alternate host must have a user account on your Meeting Center Web site.  Once you invite an attendee to a meeting as an alternate host, the attendee receives an invitation email message that provides information about acting as the alternate host. Your scheduled meeting appears on the alternate host\\'s My WebEx Meetings page.  Can I invite people using my online address book?  You do not have to type the email address of each person you want to invite to your meeting. You can select attendees and sales team members (for Sales Center meetings) from your address book.  You can access your address book from the Invite Attendees page (for Meeting Center meetings) or the Invite Participants page (for WebEx Sales Center meetings) in the Advanced Scheduler.

For details, see Inviting more people to your in-progress meeting (on page 5).  Why should I request that attendees check their systems for UCF compatibility?  When scheduling a meeting, you can add a request to invitation email messages for attendees to verify that the following components are installed on their computers for playing Universal Communications Format (UCF) media files:  \\uf0a7 Flash Player, for playing a Flash movie or interactive Flash files  \\uf0a7 Windows Media Player for playing audio or video files  This option is useful if you or another presenter plans to share a UCF multimedia presentation or standalone UCF media files during the meeting.  Your request automatically appears in any invitation email messages that you send to attendees using the Advanced Scheduler invitation options. Your request also includes a link that attendees can click to access the Verify Rich Media Players page on your Meeting Center Web site. This page allows attendees to automatically verify that the required players are installed on their computers.  Note: If you intend to allow attendees to share to share UCF multimedia presentations or standalone UCF media files, ensure that the Enable UCF rich media for attendees check box is selected on the Meeting Options page in the Advanced Scheduler.  How can I learn about the fields on the Invite Attendees page?  Click the Help link in the top right corner of the Invite Attendees page, or review About the Invite Attendees page.  Can I use my online address book to invite attendees?  You do not have to type the email address of each person you want to invite to your meeting. You can select attendees from your address book.  You can access your address book from the Invite Attendees page in the Advanced Scheduler.  How can I enhance meeting security?  When scheduling a meeting, you can require all attendees to have a user account on your site. If you include this requirement (an option on the Invite Attendees page), attendees must log in to your Meeting Center Web site to attend the meeting, which enhances meeting security.

Requiring registration allows you to:    Chapter 5: Scheduling a Meeting    115    \\uf0a7 View a list of attendees to determine whether they have registered for the meeting  \\uf0a7 Obtain attendees\\' names, email addresses, and optionally additional personal information before they can join the meeting  \\uf0a7 Accept or reject individual registration requests  \\uf0a7 Increase the security of your meeting  If you invite an attendee to a meeting that requires registration, the attendee receives an invitation email message that includes information about the meeting and a link that the attendee can click to register for the meeting.  Important: If you accept registration requests automatically for a meeting that requires a password—and an attendee registers after the meeting has already started—the attendee can join the meeting immediately, without providing the password. Therefore, to secure a meeting from unauthorized access, you must clear the Automatically accept all registration requests check box, and manually accept or reject all registration requests.  If you do not accept registration requests automatically for a meeting that requires a password— and an attendee registers after the meeting has already started—the attendee cannot join the meeting until he or she receives a registration confirmation email message and can provide the meeting password. During the meeting, you can check for registration requests in your email program and accept them to allow attendees to join the meeting.  How do I accept or reject registration requests?  If you scheduled a meeting for which attendees must register, you can accept or reject attendees\\' registration requests. If you accept a registration request, a registration confirmation email message which provides the meeting password, if any is sent the attendee. If you reject a registration request, a registration rejection email message is sent to the attendee.  Note: If you select the Automatically accept all registration requests check box on the Registration page, all registration requests are accepted automatically and a registration confirmation email message is sent to each attendee who registers.

A meeting host who is also the presenter can always share UCF media files, whether or not you select this check box.    Note: A presenter can change the default privileges for all attendees or individual attendees at any time during a meeting.  Questions about setting meeting options  What are some rules of thumb for sharing UCF media files?  When scheduling a meeting, you can allow attendees to share Universal Communications Format (UCF) media files during the meeting, either in a UCF multimedia presentation or as standalone UCF media files.  You can also prevent attendees from sharing UCF media files during a meeting. If you do so, only the meeting host can share UCF media files when also acting as the presenter.  You may want to prevent attendees from sharing UCF media files, for example, if you intend to allow attendees to share presentations or documents but want to prevent an attendee from inadvertently sharing a very large media file.  Note: The alerts options are applicable only if you select an integrated teleconference on the Teleconference page in the Advanced Scheduler.

If you share a Web page, participants view and interact independently with the content on the page. If the page contains links to other pages, they can also navigate independently to those pages.  Sharing Web Content   Chapter 14: Sharing Web Content    240    If you use Web content sharing, then, participants can experience audio and video effects on a Web page. However, unlike Web browser sharing, this option does not allow you to guide participants to other Web pages. For more information, see Differences between sharing Web content and sharing a Web browser (on page 240).  Important: If you share content that requires a media player, participants can view and interact with the content only if the appropriate player is installed on their computers.  Sharing Web content You can share a Web page that contains multimedia effects. The page opens in the content viewer on each participant\\'s screen.  To share Web content:  1 On the Share menu, choose Web Content.  The Share Web Content dialog box appears.  2 In the Address box, enter the address, or URL, at which the content resides.  Or, if you have previously shared the content, select it in the drop-down list.  3 In the Type box, select the type of Web content that you want to share.  4 Click OK.  Tip: You can copy a URL from any source, such as another browser window, and then paste it in the Address box.  Differences between sharing Web content and sharing a Web browser Meeting Center provides two options for sharing Web-based information. You can share Web content or share a Web browser with meeting participants. Choose the  feature that better suits your needs.

This button is the third button from the left on the Controls panel.  2 On the menu that appears, choose Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control > [name of  participant].    Automatically letting participants remotely control shared software Host or Presenter only  While sharing software, you can automatically grant control of the software to a participant who requests control. In this case, a participant who requests remote control automatically takes control of the software that you are sharing. While automatic remote control is turned on, any participant can take control away from any other participant by requesting remote control.  To automatically let participants control shared software:  1 On the Meeting Controls Panel select the down-arrow button on the Assign  button.    Chapter 15: Sharing Software    277            2 On the menu that appears, choose Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control > Auto  Accept All Requests.  To stop letting participants control shared software automatically:  1 On the Meeting Controls Panel select the down-arrow button on the Assign  button.  2 On the menu that appears, choose Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control. Then  select Auto Accept All Requests to remove the check mark and cancel the selection.  Stopping remote control of shared software Host or Presenter only  While a participant is remotely controlling a shared application, desktop, or Web browser, you can take back control of the shared software at any time. You can do either of the following:  \\uf0a7 Take back remote control of shared software temporarily, allowing a participant to take control at any time.  \\uf0a7 Prevent a participant from further controlling shared software.  To take back control a shared software temporarily:  On your computer\\'s desktop, select your mouse.  You can now control the shared software.  The participant who was controlling the shared software can take back control at any time by clicking his or her mouse.   Chapter 15: Sharing Software    278    To prevent a participant from further controlling a shared software:  1 On your computer\\'s desktop, click your mouse.  You can now control the shared software.  On the Meeting Controls Panel select the down-arrow button on the Assign button.        2 On the menu that appears, choose Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control.  A menu appears, containing a list of all participants in the meeting. A check mark appears to the left of the participant who has remote control.  3 Choose the participant\\'s name to remove the check mark and cancel the selection.  Sharing applications with detailed color (Windows) For Windows users only  By default, Meeting Manager sends images of shared software using 16-bit color mode, which is the equivalent of your computer\\'s “High Color” (16-bit) setting. This mode provides an accurate representation of color for most shared applications. However, if your shared application contains detailed color images-such as color gradients-the color may not appear accurately on participants\\' screens. For example, color gradients may appear and color “bands.”  If the accuracy and resolution of color in a shared application is important, you can turn on True Color mode in Meeting Manager. Using this mode, however, may affect the performance of application sharing.  When using True Color mode, you can select one of the following options:  \\uf0a7 Better imaging (no image compression)    Chapter 15: Sharing Software    279    \\uf0a7 Better performance (some image compression)  “Performance” refers to the “speed” at which images appear on participant screens, and “imaging” refers to the quality of the color in shared images.  Note: Before turning on True Color mode, ensure that your monitor display is set to True Color (either 24- or 32-bit color). For more information about setting options for your monitor, refer to Windows Help.  To turn on True Color mode:  1 If you are currently sharing an application, stop your sharing session.  2 On the Meeting menu, choose Meeting Options.  The Meeting Options dialog box appears.  3 Select the True Color Mode tab.  4 Select Enable True Color mode.  5 Select one of the following options:  \\uf0a7 Better imaging  \\uf0a7 Better performance  6 Select OK or Apply.    Sharing applications with detailed color (Mac) For Mac users only  Before sharing an application or your desktop, you can choose one of the following display modes:  \\uf0a7 Better performance: The default mode. Lets you display your content faster than you do using the better image quality mode.  \\uf0a7 Better image quality: Lets you display your content with better image quality. In this mode, your shared content may take longer time to display than in the better performance mode.    Note: Changing the display mode does not affect presentation or document sharing.  To choose a display mode for your shared desktop or applications:  1 In the Meeting window, on the Meeting Center menu, choose Preferences.   Chapter 15: Sharing Software    280    The Preferences dialog box appears.  2 Select Display.        The display mode options appear.  3 Select Better performance or Better image quality, as appropriate.  Tips for sharing software The following tips can help you to share software more effectively:  \\uf0a7 Application sharing only: To save time during a meeting, ensure that any applications you intend to share are open on your computer. At the appropriate time during the meeting, you can then quickly begin sharing an application, without waiting for the application to start.  \\uf0a7 If participants cannot see all of the shared software without scrolling their sharing windows, they can adjust their views of the shared software. They can reduce the size of the shared software in decrements, or scale it to fit inside their sharing windows.  \\uf0a7 To improve the performance of software sharing, close all applications that you do not need to use or share on your computer. Doing so conserves processor usage and memory on your computer, thus helping to ensure that Meeting Manager can send images of shared software quickly during a meeting. Also, to ensure that a maximum amount of bandwidth is available for software sharing, close any applications that use bandwidth, such as instant messaging or chat programs, and programs that receive streaming audio or video from the Web.    Chapter 15: Sharing Software    281    \\uf0a7 If you are sharing an application for which the rendering of color on participants\\' screen is important, you can improve color quality by turning on True Color mode. For details, see Sharing applications with detailed color (on page 278).  \\uf0a7 Application and Web browser sharing only: Avoid covering a shared application or Web browser with another window on your computer\\'s desktop. A crosshatched pattern appears in participant sharing windows where the other window is covering the shared application or browser.  \\uf0a7 Application and Web browser sharing only: If you want to switch your display between shared software and the Meeting window, you can pause software sharing before you return to the Meeting window, and then resume sharing once you return to the shared application. Pausing software sharing conserves processor usage and memory on your computer while you view the Meeting window. For details, see Pausing and resuming software sharing. (on page 261)  \\uf0a7 Application and Web browser sharing only: If you have more than one monitor, when you share an application or web browser, the participants can see it on whichever monitor you are displaying it. If you move the application or Web browser to another monitor, it is still visible to the participants. If you are sharing more than one application, the participants will see the best view if you make sure the applications are displaying on the same monitor.  \\uf0a7 Because software sharing requires additional bandwidth during a meeting, it is recommended that you use a dedicated, high-speed Internet connection when sharing software. However, if participants are using dial-up Internet connections, they may notice a delay in viewing or controlling shared software. If you want to share a document, such as a Microsoft Word or Excel document, you can improve the meeting experience for these participants by using document sharing instead of application sharing.      16    283    Chapter 16  During a meeting, you can poll participants by presenting them with a questionnaire. Conducting a poll can be useful for gathering feedback from participants, allowing participants to vote on a proposal, testing participant knowledge of a topic, and so on.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  Version 2, June 1991  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to tak  e away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software   9 Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  Foundations software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and or modify the software.  Also, for each authors protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any   10  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  patent must be licensed for everyones free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each li  censee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Programs  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License  along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion   11  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third  parties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program norm  ally reads commands interactively  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a  notice that there is no warranty (  or else, saying that you provide  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under  these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but  does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered ind  ependent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.   12  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections  1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete  machine-readable copy of the co  rresponding source code, to be  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  customarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer  to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you  received the program in object code or executable form with such  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code d  istributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.   13  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses  terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of  this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this   14  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distrib  ution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in r  eliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to   15  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software w  hich is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO W  ARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AR  ISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED   16  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.3.1 Available under license :  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the programs name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and or modify  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or  (at your option) any later version.

Preamble     The licenses for most software are designed to tak  e away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundations software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.     When we speak of free software, we are referri  ng to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether   19  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.4.1 Available under license :  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and or modify the software.     Also, for each author  s protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors reputations.     Finally, any free program is threat  ened constantly by software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we ha  ve made it clear that any  patent must be licensed for everyones free use or not licensed at all.     The precise terms and conditions f  or copying, distribution and  modification follow.     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"\"Program\"\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"\"work based on the Program\"\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing th  e Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another  language.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing th  e Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".     23  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Programs  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License  along with the Program.    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet  all of these conditions:     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third   parties under the terms of this License.     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a   notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this   24  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but   does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on   the Program is not required to print an announcement.)    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered ind  ependent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.    In addition, mere aggregation of anoth  er work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your   cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete   machine-readable copy of the co  rresponding source code, to be   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium   customarily used for software interchange; or,   25  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.5.1 Available under license :    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer   to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   received the program in object c  ode or executable form with such   an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)    The source code for a work means the preferred form of  the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source co  de for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code distributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   Version 2, June 1991     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     Preamble     The licenses for most software are design  ed to take away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundations software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.   37  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give the reci  pients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and or modify the software.     Also, for each authors p  rotection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified b  y someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors reputations.     Finally, any free program is threatened constantly b  y software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any  patent must be licensed for everyones free use or not licensed at all.     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,   38  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Programs  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a cop  y of this License  along with the Program.    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet  all of these conditions:     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third   parties under the terms of this License.     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an   39  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a   notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this   License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but   does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on   the Program is not required to print an announcement.)    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered ind  ependent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and every part re  gardless of who wrote it.    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.    In addition, mere aggregation of anoth  er work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your   40  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium   customarily used for soft  ware interchange; or,     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer   to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   received the program in object code or executable form with such   an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code d  istributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable ru  ns, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source alon  g with the object code.     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.     5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or   41  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or an  y work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients exercise of  the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.    If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. M  any people have made   42  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  impose that choice.    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.     8. If the distribution and or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original copyright holder wh  o places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.     10. If you wish to incorporate parts of t  he Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     43  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  NO WARRANTY     11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES A  RISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH H  OLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistrib  ute and change under these terms.     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     44  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :  <one line to give the programs name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and or modify   it under the terms of the GNU General P  ublic License as published by   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or   (at your option) any later version.     This program is distributed in t  he hope that it will be useful,   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the   GNU General Public License for more details.     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along   with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type show w.   This is free software, and you are w  elcome to redistribute it   under certain conditions; type show c for details.    The hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may  be called something other than show w and show c; they could even be  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program   Gnomovision (which makes passes at co  mpilers) written by James Hacker.   45  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.9.1 Available under license :    <signature of Ty Coon> , 1 April 1989   Ty Coon, President of Vice    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into  proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the  library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  Public License instead of this License.   46  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10 Mindspeed Firmware Loader for TSP3 Chip Unknown  1.10 Mindspeed Firmware Loader for TSP3 Chip Unknown  1.10.1 Available under license :  Code is provided by a vendor, Mindspeed.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet  all of these conditions:     a) You must cause the modified f  iles to carry prominent notices   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third   parties under the terms of this License.     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a   49  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :  notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this   License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but   does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on   the Program is not required to print an announcement.)    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered ind  ependent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.    In addition, mere aggregation of anoth  er work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your   cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete   50  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium   customarily used for software interchange; or,     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer   to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   received the program in object code or e  xecutable form with such   an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)    The source code for a work means the preferred form of  the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code distributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source along with the  object code.     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.     5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are   51  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients exercise of  the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.    If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. M  any people have made  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed   52  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  impose that choice.    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.     8. If the distribution and or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original copyright holder wh  o places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.     10. If you wish to incorporate parts of t  he Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     NO WARRANTY   53  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PR  OGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LA  W OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES A  RISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     <one line to give the programs name and a brief idea of what it does.>   54  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.10.1 Available under license :  Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and or modify   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or   (at your option) any later version.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type show w.   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it   under certain conditions; type show c for details.    The hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may  be called something other than show w and show c; they could even be  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary.

(You will not be required to justify it to the  Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large  as a market that must bear the fee.)     62  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item  itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it  under the same conditions they received it.    1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the  Standard Version of this Package witho  ut restriction, provided that you  duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications  derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package  modified in such a way shall still be conside  red the Standard Version.    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and  when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the  following:     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them   Freely Available, such as by post  ing said modifications to Usenet or   an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive   site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include   your modifications in the Standa  rd Version of the Package.     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict   with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide   a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly   documents how it differs from the Standard Version.     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or  executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,   together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where   63  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  to get the Standard Version.     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of   the Package with your modifications.     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly   document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together   with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this  Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this  Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,  you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly  commercial) programs as part of a lar  ger (possibly commercial) software  distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a  product of your own. You may embed this Packages interpreter within  an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere  form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the  interpreter is so embedded.    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as  output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall  under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated  them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this  Package. If such scripts or librar  y files are aggregated with this  Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a  binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall  neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it  fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do  not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this  Package.    7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other  languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to  emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this  Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the   64  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do  not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the  regression tests for the language.    8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always  permitted provided that the use of t  his Package is embedded; that is,  when no overt attempt is made to make this Packages interfaces visible  to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be  construed as a distribution of this Package.    9.

Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make   65  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free  software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,  that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free  programs; and that you know you can do these things.     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give t  he recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must tell them their rights.     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and or modify the software.     Also, for each author  s protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified b  y someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors reputations.     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be  distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The  \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based  on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the   66  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each  licensee is addressed as \"you\".     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Programs source  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this  General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any  other recipients of the Program a cop  y of this General Public License  along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of  transferring a copy.     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of  it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph  1 above, provided that you also do the following:     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that   you changed the files and the date of any change; and     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that   in whole or in part contains the Program or an  y part thereof, either   with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all   third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except   that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all   third parties, at your option).     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when   run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use   in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice   that there is no warranty (or else, sayin  g that you provide a   warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these   conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General   Public License.     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a   copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in   exchange for a fee.   67  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its  derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring  the other work under the scope of these terms.       3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of  it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     a) accompany it with the compl  ete corresponding machine-readable   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge   for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the   corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,     c) accompany it with the informa  tion you received as to where the   corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   received the program in object code or executable form alone.)    Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making  modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means  all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special  exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard  libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable  file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that  accompany that operating system.     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the  Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer  the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use  the Program under this License. However, parties who have received   68  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties  remain in full compliance.     5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based  on the Program) you indicate your accept  ance of this license to do so,  and all its terms and conditions.     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original  licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these  terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the  recipients exercise of the rights granted herein.       7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of the lice  nse which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.     8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     NO WARRANTY     69  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE  LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DA  MAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES A  RISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH H  OLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these  terms.     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to  attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey  the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the  \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     70  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.13.1 Available under license :  <one line to give the programs name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and or modify   it under the terms of the GNU General P  ublic License as published by   the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)   any later version.     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the   GNU General Public License for more details.     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License   along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,   Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.    Also add information on how to contact you b  y electronic and paper mail.    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type show w.   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it   under certain conditions; type show c for details.    The hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the  appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the  commands you use may be called something other than show w and show  c; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your  program.    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE  ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting  Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http:  www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands  as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Pythons  principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for  National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see htt  p:  www.cnri.reston.va.us)  in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the  software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to  BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same  year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (see  http:  www.digicool.com). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation  (PSF, see http:  www.python.org psf ) was formed, a non-profit  organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual  Property. Digital Creations is a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http:  www.opensource.org for  the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python  releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes  the various releases.  Release Derived Year Owner GPL-  from compatible? (1)  0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes  1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes   73  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.14.1 Available under license :  1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no  2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no  1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI no  2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no  2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes  2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes  2.2 2.1.1 2001 PSF yes  2.2.1 2.2 2002 PSF yes  Footnotes:  (1) GPL-compatible doesnt mean that were distributing Python under  the GPL. All Python licenses, un  like the GPL, let you distribute  a modified version without making your changes open source. The  GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with  other software that is released under the GPL; the others dont.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guidos  direction to make these releases possible.  B.

Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to tak  e away your  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundations software and to any other program whose authors commit to  using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to  your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,   80  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  distribute and or modify the software.  Also, for each authors protection and ours, we want to make certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  authors reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  program proprietary. To prevent this, we ha  ve made it clear that any  patent must be licensed for everyones free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,  either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on w  hat the Program does.   81  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Programs  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License  along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third  parties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program norm  ally reads commands interactively  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a  notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under  these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but  does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in   82  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  entire whole, and thus to each and e  very part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of anoth  er work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections  1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete  machine-readable copy of the co  rresponding source code, to be  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  customarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer  to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you  received the program in object code or executable form with such  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)   83  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code d  istributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  compelled to copy the source along with the  object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  this License will not have their licenses  terminated so long as such  parties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further   84  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  this License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held in  valid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  be a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the   85  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  Foundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  to ask for permission. For software w  hich is copyrighted by the Free  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND OR OTHER PARTIES  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,   86  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AR  ISING  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the programs name and a brief idea of what it does.>   Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and or modify  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or  (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the   87  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  Also add information on how to contact you b  y electronic and paper mail.  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author  Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w.  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  under certain conditions; type `show c for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w and `show c should show the appropriate  parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may  be called something other than `show w and `show c; they could even be  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program  `Gnomovision (which makes passes at co  mpilers) written by James Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon> , 1 April 1989  Ty Coon, President of Vice  This General Public License does not permit  incorporating your program into  proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the  library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General  Public License instead of this License.   88  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.16.1 Available under license :  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  For further information, contact:  John Pawling, John.Pawling@DigitalNet.com  DigitalNet, LLC  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   89  Open Source Used In Cisco IOS XR Release 4.3.0  1.17 TAO ACE ORB 1.2a  1.17 TAO ACE ORB 1.2a  1.17.1 Available under license :  Copyright and Licensing Information for ACE(TM), TAO(TM), and CIAO(TM)  [1]ACE(TM), [2]TAO(TM) and [3]CIAO(TM) are copyrighted by [4]Douglas C.

overall management of the meeting. The meeting window provides a forum for you to manage all aspects of the meeting and enable participants to chat, send video, share information and interact with each other via documents, presentations, whiteboards, applications, and more.  Some of the most common tasks that you can perform as host are described below:     Edit your welcome message (on page 17)   Record the meeting (on page 4)   Invite more people (on page 5)   Remind invitees to join (on page 10)   Change presenters (on page 11)   Make someone else the host (on page 14)   Send a transcript (on page 19)   End the meeting (on page 20).  A host can often be a presenter. For instructions on presenting information, see Sharing Files and Whiteboards (on page 217) and Sharing Software (on page 243).  Hosting and Managing a Meeting   Chapter 1: Hosting and Managing a Meeting    2      Note: For a more in-depth understanding of how to navigate the meeting window, go to A quick tour of the meeting window (on page 21).    Interacting with other participants After you start or join a meeting, the meeting window opens and on the right side, you can see all participants who are in the meeting.

Any presenter can also pass the ball to make another meeting  participant the presenter.  There are numerous ways to make someone the presenter depending on how you are viewing participants.

Chapter 1: Hosting and Managing a Meeting    18    Restricting access to a meeting Once a host starts a meeting, the host can restrict access to it at any time. This option prevents anyone from joining the meeting, including participants who have been invited to the meeting but have not yet joined it.  To restrict access to a meeting:  1 In the Meeting window, on the Meeting menu, choose Restrict Access.  Participants can no longer join the meeting.  2 Optional. To restore access to the meeting, on the Meeting menu, choose Restore  Access.    Removing a participant from a meeting The meeting host can remove a participant from a meeting at any time.  To remove a participant from a meeting:  1 In the Meeting window, open the Participants panel.  2 Select the name of the participant whom you want to remove from the meeting.  3 On the Participant menu, choose Expel.  A confirmation message appears, in which you can verify that you want to remove the participant from the meeting.  4 Click Yes.  The participant is removed from the meeting.

Leaving a meeting You can leave a meeting at any time. If you are participating in WebEx audio, or an integrated voice conference, Meeting Manager disconnects you from the audio after you leave the meeting.    Chapter 1: Hosting and Managing a Meeting    19    To leave a meeting:  1 In the Meeting window, on the File menu, choose Leave Meeting.  A confirmation message appears in which you can verify that you want to leave the meeting.  2 Click Yes.  The Meeting window closes.

Sending a meeting transcript to participants You can send a transcript of a meeting to all participants at any time during the meeting. The transcript is an email message that contains the following general information:   Meeting topic   Meeting number   Meeting starting and ending times   URL for the Meeting Information page for the meeting on your meeting service Web site   List of participants who have joined the meeting (audio-only participants are not listed)   Meeting agenda   Any public notes that you took during the meeting  You can optionally attach any of the following files to the transcript, if you saved them during the meeting:   Shared documents   Chat     Poll questionnaire   Poll results     Public notes or closed captions that you took or that the note taker or closed captionist published during the meeting   Chapter 1: Hosting and Managing a Meeting    20    To send a meeting transcript to participants:  1 In the Meeting window, on the File menu, choose Send Transcript.  If you have saved any files during the meeting, the Send Transcript dialog box appears, allowing you to attach the files to the transcript email message.  If you have not saved any files during the meeting, a transcript email message opens.  2 If the Send Transcript dialog box appears, select the check box for each file that  you want to attach to the transcript, and then click OK.  The transcript email message opens.  3 Review the email message and make any changes that you want.  4 Send the email message.

Audio-only participants will not be listed on the transcript. For security purposes, a participant who receives a transcript email message cannot see the email addresses for the other participants. The transcript contains notes only if you are the meeting host, the public note taker, or the closed captionist, and you have saved the notes to a file. If all participants can take private notes, the transcript email message does not include your private notes, and the option to attach your notes in a file is not available. If you saved notes or closed captions to a file, the transcript email message and the attached notes file contain the latest version of notes that you saved. If you are the meeting host and end the meeting-and you have not sent a transcript-a message appears, asking you if you want to send a transcript.

To end a meeting:  1 In the Meeting window, on the File menu, choose End Meeting.    Chapter 1: Hosting and Managing a Meeting    21    A confirmation message appears, in which you can verify that you want to end the meeting.  2 Optional.

The Meeting window closes.  Tip: Alternatively, as the meeting host, you can leave a meeting without ending it. Before you leave a meeting, you should first transfer the host role to another participant. For more information, see Transferring the host role to a participant (on page 15).  A Quick Tour of the Meeting Window The Meeting window provides a forum for you to share information and interact with participants via documents, presentations, whiteboards, applications, and more.  You share or view content using the tools in the Meeting window. You can use panels to chat, take notes, and perform other tasks.  When you start or join a meeting, your meeting window opens with the Quick Start area on the left and a panel area on the right.

If a meeting is unlisted, the meeting details, such as its host, topic, and starting time are not available on the calendar and other places. This additional security may help prevent unauthorized access to the meeting.  To join an unlisted meeting, a participant must provide a unique meeting number.  If you invite a participant to an unlisted meeting, the participant receives an invitation email message that includes complete instructions for joining the meeting-including the meeting number-and a URL that links directly to a Web page on which the participant can join the meeting.  What are tracking codes?  Your site administrator can include tracking codes in the Advanced Scheduler. Tracking codes may identify your department, project, or other information that your organization wants to associate with your meeting. Tracking codes can be optional or required, depending on how your site administrator sets them up.  How can I learn more about the fields on the Required Information page?

To provide audio during a meeting, you can use one of the following voice conferencing services:   Integrated call-in teleconference-A teleconference that a participant can join by calling a phone number. The number to call automatically appears in a message box when a participant joins a meeting. If your meeting service provides toll-free call-in teleconferencing, both a toll-free number and a toll number are available. The global call-in option provides a list of numbers-such as toll-free or local numbers-that attendees in other countries can call to join the teleconference.   Integrated call-back teleconference-A teleconference that a participant can join by providing his or her phone number when joining a meeting. The participant enters his or her number in a dialog box that appears when he or she joins the meeting. The teleconferencing service calls the participant at the number he or she provided.    Chapter 5: Scheduling a Meeting    107     If your site includes the international call-back option, participants in other countries can receive a call back. For more information about this option, ask your meeting service site administrator.   Third-party or internal teleconference-Any teleconferencing service other than the integrated teleconferencing service. You can use any third-party teleconferencing service or internal teleconferencing system, and provide instructions for joining teleconference when setting up a meeting. Your instructions automatically appear in a message box when a participant joins the meeting.  What are the system requirements for VoIP?  To use VoIP, ensure that your computer meets the following system requirements:   A supported sound card  For a current list of supported sound cards, refer to the Frequently Asked Questions page on your Meeting Center Web site. You can access this page from your site\\'s Support page.   Speakers or headphones   Microphone, if you want to speak during the conference  Tip: For better audio quality and greater convenience, use a computer headset with a high-quality microphone.  When should I include VoIP?   Your meeting includes remote attendees who do not want to be charged for long-distance phone calls.   Your meeting will not involve much interaction-for example, attendees will listen to a presentation instead of engage in a discussion.   You want to minimize the voice conferencing costs for the meeting.  Check that your computer has the minimum system requirements for VoIP. For details, see About the Audio Conference Settings page (on page 103).  What is a dual-mode voice conference and when should I use it?  You can set up a dual-mode voice conference for a scheduled or instant meeting-that is, a voice conference that includes both a teleconference and VoIP. In a dual-mode voice conference, participants can use either type of service.   Chapter 5: Scheduling a Meeting    108    In a dual-mode voice conference, a participant can listen to audio using either a phone or speakers attached to his or her computer. To speak, a participant can use either a phone or microphone attached to his or her computer.  Note:  Participants in a teleconference can speak to and hear only other participants in the teleconference. Similarly, participants using VoIP can speak to and hear only other participants using VoIP. Thus, the dual-mode conference option is usually appropriate for a  meeting in which participants will listen to a presentation only and not interact in the voice conference.  All participants can listen to a presentation if the presenter speaks into both a phone and a microphone.  How can I learn about the fields on the Audio Conference Settings page?

Questions about setting meeting options  What are some rules of thumb for sharing UCF media files?  When scheduling a meeting, you can allow attendees to share Universal Communications Format (UCF) media files during the meeting, either in a UCF multimedia presentation or as standalone UCF media files.  You can also prevent attendees from sharing UCF media files during a meeting. If you do so, only the meeting host can share UCF media files when also acting as the presenter.  You may want to prevent attendees from sharing UCF media files, for example, if you intend to allow attendees to share presentations or documents but want to prevent an attendee from inadvertently sharing a very large media file.

If you share a Web page, participants view and interact independently with the content on the page. If the page contains links to other pages, they can also navigate independently to those pages.  Sharing Web Content   Chapter 14: Sharing Web Content    240    If you use Web content sharing, then, participants can experience audio and video effects on a Web page. However, unlike Web browser sharing, this option does not allow you to guide participants to other Web pages. For more information, see Differences between sharing Web content and sharing a Web browser (on page 240).  Important: If you share content that requires a media player, participants can view and interact with the content only if the appropriate player is installed on their computers.  Sharing Web content You can share a Web page that contains multimedia effects. The page opens in the content viewer on each participant\\'s screen.  To share Web content:  1 On the Share menu, choose Web Content.  The Share Web Content dialog box appears.  2 In the Address box, enter the address, or URL, at which the content resides.  Or, if you have previously shared the content, select it in the drop-down list.  3 In the Type box, select the type of Web content that you want to share.  4 Click OK.  Tip: You can copy a URL from any source, such as another browser window, and then paste it in the Address box.  Differences between sharing Web content and sharing a Web browser Meeting Center provides two options for sharing Web-based information. You can share Web content or share a Web browser with meeting participants. Choose the  feature that better suits your needs.    Chapter 14: Sharing Web Content    241      Sharing option Advantages Disadvantages  Web browser sharing  Lets you guide  participants to various Web pages and sites on the Web.   Lets you grant attendees control of your Web browser.   Lets you and other participants annotate Web pages.   Does not display media effects or transmit sounds on Web pages.   Does not let participants interact with Web pages independently.  Web content sharing  Displays Web pages, and lets participants experience media effects on Web pages, including video and sound.   Lets participants interact with Web pages independently in their content viewers.  Does not let you guide participants to other Web pages.        15    243    Chapter 15  Sharing a tool, like a software application, works differently from sharing a document or presentation. When you share software during a meeting, a sharing window opens automatically on all participant screens. You can show, in this special sharing window:   an application (for example, you want to edit a document as a group or show your team how a tool works)   computer desktop (for easily sharing several applications at once and for sharing file directories open on your computer)   web browser (useful for sharing particular Web pages with participants or showing a private intranet)   any application or the desktop on a remote computer with Access Anywhere installed on it (for example, you are on the road, and the computer in your office has the information you need)  Your site settings and your user role in a meeting determines your level of participation in sharing software.

Once you assume remote control of shared software, you can interact with it fully.  To request remote control of shared software:  On the Meeting Controls Panel select Ask to Control.      A request message appears on the presenter\\'s screen.   Chapter 15: Sharing Software    276      Tip: While remotely controlling shared software, you can request the presenter to allow you to annotate it. For details, see Requesting annotation control of shared software. (on page 272)  Letting a participant remotely control shared software Host or Presenter only  If you are sharing software, you can let a participant control it remotely.  To let a participant remotely control shared software:  1 On the Meeting Controls Panel select the down-arrow button on the Assign  button.        This button is the third button from the left on the Controls panel.  2 On the menu that appears, choose Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control > [name of  participant].    Automatically letting participants remotely control shared software Host or Presenter only  While sharing software, you can automatically grant control of the software to a participant who requests control. In this case, a participant who requests remote control automatically takes control of the software that you are sharing. While automatic remote control is turned on, any participant can take control away from any other participant by requesting remote control.  To automatically let participants control shared software:  1 On the Meeting Controls Panel select the down-arrow button on the Assign  button.    Chapter 15: Sharing Software    277            2 On the menu that appears, choose Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control > Auto  Accept All Requests.

Stopping remote control of shared software Host or Presenter only  While a participant is remotely controlling a shared application, desktop, or Web browser, you can take back control of the shared software at any time. You can do either of the following:   Take back remote control of shared software temporarily, allowing a participant to take control at any time.   Prevent a participant from further controlling shared software.  To take back control a shared software temporarily:  On your computer\\'s desktop, select your mouse.  You can now control the shared software.  The participant who was controlling the shared software can take back control at any time by clicking his or her mouse.   Chapter 15: Sharing Software    278    To prevent a participant from further controlling a shared software:  1 On your computer\\'s desktop, click your mouse.  You can now control the shared software.  On the Meeting Controls Panel select the down-arrow button on the Assign button.        2 On the menu that appears, choose Pass Keyboard and Mouse Control.  A menu appears, containing a list of all participants in the meeting. A check mark appears to the left of the participant who has remote control.  3 Choose the participant\\'s name to remove the check mark and cancel the selection.  Sharing applications with detailed color (Windows) For Windows users only  By default, Meeting Manager sends images of shared software using 16-bit color mode, which is the equivalent of your computer\\'s High Color (16-bit) setting. This mode provides an accurate representation of color for most shared applications. However, if your shared application contains detailed color images-such as color gradients-the color may not appear accurately on participants\\' screens. For example, color gradients may appear and color bands.  If the accuracy and resolution of color in a shared application is important, you can turn on True Color mode in Meeting Manager. Using this mode, however, may affect the performance of application sharing.  When using True Color mode, you can select one of the following options:   Better imaging (no image compression)    Chapter 15: Sharing Software    279     Better performance (some image compression)  Performance refers to the speed at which images appear on participant screens, and imaging refers to the quality of the color in shared images.  Note: Before turning on True Color mode, ensure that your monitor display is set to True Color (either 24- or 32-bit color). For more information about setting options for your monitor, refer to Windows Help.  To turn on True Color mode:  1 If you are currently sharing an application, stop your sharing session.  2 On the Meeting menu, choose Meeting Options.  The Meeting Options dialog box appears.  3 Select the True Color Mode tab.  4 Select Enable True Color mode.  5 Select one of the following options:   Better imaging   Better performance  6 Select OK or Apply.    Sharing applications with detailed color (Mac) For Mac users only  Before sharing an application or your desktop, you can choose one of the following display modes:   Better performance: The default mode. Lets you display your content faster than you do using the better image quality mode.   Better image quality: Lets you display your content with better image quality. In this mode, your shared content may take longer time to display than in the better performance mode.    Note: Changing the display mode does not affect presentation or document sharing.  To choose a display mode for your shared desktop or applications:  1 In the Meeting window, on the Meeting Center menu, choose Preferences.   Chapter 15: Sharing Software    280    The Preferences dialog box appears.  2 Select Display.        The display mode options appear.  3 Select Better performance or Better image quality, as appropriate.  Tips for sharing software The following tips can help you to share software more effectively:   Application sharing only: To save time during a meeting, ensure that any applications you intend to share are open on your computer. At the appropriate time during the meeting, you can then quickly begin sharing an application, without waiting for the application to start.   If participants cannot see all of the shared software without scrolling their sharing windows, they can adjust their views of the shared software. They can reduce the size of the shared software in decrements, or scale it to fit inside their sharing windows.   To improve the performance of software sharing, close all applications that you do not need to use or share on your computer. Doing so conserves processor usage and memory on your computer, thus helping to ensure that Meeting Manager can send images of shared software quickly during a meeting. Also, to ensure that a maximum amount of bandwidth is available for software sharing, close any applications that use bandwidth, such as instant messaging or chat programs, and programs that receive streaming audio or video from the Web.    Chapter 15: Sharing Software    281     If you are sharing an application for which the rendering of color on participants\\' screen is important, you can improve color quality by turning on True Color mode. For details, see Sharing applications with detailed color (on page 278).   Application and Web browser sharing only: Avoid covering a shared application or Web browser with another window on your computer\\'s desktop. A crosshatched pattern appears in participant sharing windows where the other window is covering the shared application or browser.   Application and Web browser sharing only: If you want to switch your display between shared software and the Meeting window, you can pause software sharing before you return to the Meeting window, and then resume sharing once you return to the shared application. Pausing software sharing conserves processor usage and memory on your computer while you view the Meeting window. For details, see Pausing and resuming software sharing. (on page 261)   Application and Web browser sharing only: If you have more than one monitor, when you share an application or web browser, the participants can see it on whichever monitor you are displaying it. If you move the application or Web browser to another monitor, it is still visible to the participants. If you are sharing more than one application, the participants will see the best view if you make sure the applications are displaying on the same monitor.   Because software sharing requires additional bandwidth during a meeting, it is recommended that you use a dedicated, high-speed Internet connection when sharing software. However, if participants are using dial-up Internet connections, they may notice a delay in viewing or controlling shared software. If you want to share a document, such as a Microsoft Word or Excel document, you can improve the meeting experience for these participants by using document sharing instead of application sharing.      16    283    Chapter 16  During a meeting, you can poll participants by presenting them with a questionnaire. Conducting a poll can be useful for gathering feedback from participants, allowing participants to vote on a proposal, testing participant knowledge of a topic, and so on.

      "Application sharing only: To save time during a meeting, ensure that any applications you intend to share are open on your computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the appropriate time during the meeting, you can then quickly begin sharing an application, without waiting for the application to start.   \n",

      "\n",
      "They can reduce the size of the shared software in decrements, or scale it to fit inside their sharing windows.   \n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the performance of software sharing, close all applications that you do not need to use or share on your computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing so conserves processor usage and memory on your computer, thus helping to ensure that Meeting Manager can send images of shared software quickly during a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, to ensure that a maximum amount of bandwidth is available for software sharing, close any applications that use bandwidth, such as instant messaging or chat programs, and programs that receive streaming audio or video from the Web.    \n",
