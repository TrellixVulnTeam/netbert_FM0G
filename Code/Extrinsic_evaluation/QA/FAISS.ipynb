Along the way, the text briefly examines each layer of the OSI model.  Describing Protocols by Referencing the OSI Layers Even today , networking documents often describe TCP/IP protocols and standards by referencing OSI layers, both by layer number and layer name.  For example, a common description of a LAN switch is “Layer 2 switch,” with “Layer 2” referring to OSI layer 2.  Because OSI did have a well-defined set of functions associated with each of its seven layers, if you know those functions, you can understand what people mean when they refer to a product or function by its OSI layer.  For another example, TCP/IP’s original Internet layer, as implemented mainly by IP, equates most directly to the OSI network layer.  So, most people say that IP is a network layer protocol, or a Layer 3 protocol, using OSI terminology and numbers for the layer.  Of course, if you numbered the TCP/IP model, starting at the bottom, IP would be either Layer 2 or 3, depending on what version of the TCP/IP model you care to use.  However, even though IP is a TCP/IP protocol, everyone uses the OSI model layer names and numbers when describing IP or any other protocol for that matter.  The claim that a particular TCP/IP layer is similar to a particular OSI layer is a general comparison, but not a detailed comparison.  The comparison is a little like comparing a car to a truck: Both can get you from point A to point B, but they have many specific differences, like the truck having a truck bed in which to carry cargo.  Similarly, both the OSI and TCP/IP network layers define logical addressing and routing.  However, the addresses have a different size, and the routing logic even works differently. \n",

      "The key difference between TCP and UDP is that TCP provides a wide variety of services to applications, whereas UDP does not.  For example, routers discard packets for many reasons, including bit errors, congestion, and instances in which no correct routes are known.  As you have read already, most data-link protocols notice errors (a process called error detection) but then discard frames that have errors.  TCP provides retransmission (error recovery ) and helps to avoid congestion (flow control), whereas UDP does not.  As a result, many application protocols choose to use TCP.  However, do not let UDP’s lack of services make you think that UDP is worse than TCP.  By providing fewer services, UDP needs fewer bytes in its header compared to TCP, resulting in fewer bytes of overhead in the network.  UDP software does not slow down data transfer in cases where TCP can purposefully slow down.  Also, some applications, notably today Voice over IP (VoIP) and video over IP, do not need error recovery, so they use UDP.  So, UDP also has an important place in TCP/IP networks today.  Table 5-2 lists the main features supported by TCP/UDP.  Note that only the first item listed in the table is supported by UDP, whereas all items in the table are supported by TCP. \n",

If you decide to build your own study lab with real gear, you need to know just a little more information about serial links.  This last topic in the chapter discusses those details.  As mentioned back in Chapter 3, WAN serial links can run at a wide variety of speeds.  To deal with the wide range of speeds, routers physically slave themselves to the speed as dictated by the CSU/DSU through a process called clocking. \n",

So, now that you know a little about HDLC, it helps to think about how routers use the HDLC protocol when sending data.  First, the TCP/IP network layer focuses on forwarding IP packets from the sending host to the destination host.  The underlying LANs and WANs just act as a way to move the packets to the next router or end-user device.  Figure 3-7 shows that network layer perspective.

      "So the comparison of OSI layers to other protocol models is a general comparison of major goals, and not a comparison of the specific methods.  OSI Layers and Their Functions Today, because most people happen to be much more familiar with TCP/IP functions than with OSI functions, one of the best ways to learn about the function of different OSI layers is to think about the functions in the TCP/IP model and to correlate those with the OSI model.  For the purposes of learning, you can think of five of the OSI layers as doing the same kinds of things as the matching five layers in the TCP/IP model.  For example, the application layer of each model defines protocols to be used directly by the applications, and the physical layer of each defines the electro-mechanical details of communicating over physical connections.  Table 1-4 briefly describes each OSI layer.  34  Table 1-4 OSI Reference Model Layer Descriptions Layer Functional Description 7 Application layer.  Provides an interface from the application to the network by supplying a protocol with actions meaningful to the application, for example, “get web page object.” 6 Presentation layer.  This layer negotiates data formats, such as ASCII text, or image types like JPEG.  5 Session layer.  This layer provides methods to group multiple bidirectional messages into a workflow for easier management and easier backout of work that happened if the entire workflow fails.  4 Transport layer.  In function, much like TCP/IP’s transport layer.  This layer focuses on data delivery between the two endpoint hosts (for example, error recovery).  3 Network layer.  Like the TCP/IP network (Internet) layer, this layer defines logical addressing, routing (forwarding), and the routing protocols used to learn routes.  2 Data link layer.  Like the TCP/IP data link layer, this layer defines the protocols for delivering data over a particular single type of physical network (for example, the Ethernet data link protocols).  1 Physical layer.  This layer defines the physical characteristics of the transmission medium, including connectors, pins, use of pins, electrical currents, encoding, light modulation, and so on. \n",

      "On the exam, you should focus on isolating the root cause of the problem, after which you will either (a) fix the problem or (b) answer a multichoice question about the symptoms and the root cause of the problem.  The exam uses two question types as the primary means to test troubleshooting skills.  Sim questions begin with a broken configuration; your job is to find the configuration problem, and answer the question by fixing or completing the configuration.  These are straightforward configuration troubleshooting questions, and you can recognize them on the exam when the exam tells you to answer the question by changing the configuration.  Simlet questions also give you a simulator where you access the command-line interface (CLI).  However, instead of changing the configuration, these questions require you to verify the current operation of the network and then answer multichoice questions about the current operation.  These questions make you do the same kinds of commands you would use when doing problem isolation and documentation, and then assess what you found by asking you several multichoice questions.  At some point, whether you stop now or sometime when you have 10 to 15 spare minutes, take the time to search Cisco.com for “exam tutorial.” Cisco’s exam tutorial shows all the question types, including Sim and Simlet types, and you can take over the user interface to get a better sense for how to navigate in the same user interface you will see on exam day.  A Deeper Look at Problem Isolation On the exam, you may do 5–10 show commands in a Simlet question before finding all the answers to all the multichoice questions within that one Simlet question.  So it sometimes helps to go through problem isolation like what you would do in a real network.  In some questions, it may be obvious that the problem will be something to do with the switches or VLANs, but in others, you may have to do extra problem isolation work to even determine whether the problem is a WAN or LAN or routing problem, and which part of the network has the problem.  For example, consider the following problem based on the network in Figure 12-1.  PC1 and PC2 supposedly sit in the same VLAN (10). \n",

This means that TCP would provide error recovery, ensuring that the data was delivered.  How the Receiving Host Identifies the Correct Receiving Application This chapter closes with a discussion that pulls several concepts together from several chapters in Part I of this book.  The concept revolves around the process by which a host, when receiving any message over any network, can decide which of its many application programs should process the received data.  As an example, consider host A shown on the left side of Figure 5-14.  The host happens to have three different web browser windows open, each using a unique TCP port.

For instance, if the destination TCP port value in Figure 5-15 is 1024, host A will know that the data is meant for the first of the three web browser windows.  Before a receiving host can even examine the TCP or UDP header, and find the destination port field, it must first process the outer headers in the message.  If the incoming message is an Ethernet frame, that encapsulates an IPv4 packet, the headers look like the details in Figure 5-15. \n",

Generally, protocols use headers as a place to put information used by that protocol.  This HTTP header includes the request to “get” a file.  The request typically contains the name of the file (home.htm, in this case), or if no filename is mentioned, the web server assumes that Bob wants the default web page.  Step 2 in Figure 1-6 shows the response from web server Larry.  The message begins with an HTTP header, with a return code (200), which means something as simple as “OK” returned in the header.  HTTP also defines other return codes so that the server can tell the browser whether the request worked.  (Here is another example: If you ever looked for a web page that was not found, and then received an HTTP 404 “not found” error, you received an HTTP return code of 404.)  The second message also includes the first part of the requested file.  Step 3 in Figure 1-6 shows another message from web server Larry to web browser Bob, but this time without an HTTP header.  HTTP transfers the data by sending multiple messages, each with a part of the file.  Rather than wasting space by sending repeated HTTP headers that list the same information, these additional messages simply omit the header.

      "Note that this figure shows the same HTTP headers as Figure 1-6, but it also shows a TCP header.  The TCP header shows a sequence number (SEQ) with each message.  In this example, the network has a problem, and the network fails to deliver the TCP message (called a segment) with sequence number 2.  When Bob receives messages with sequence numbers 1 and 3, but does not receive a message with sequence number 2, Bob realizes that message 2 was lost.  That realization by Bob’s TCP logic causes Bob to send a TCP segment back to Larry, asking Larry to send message 2 again.  Same-Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions The example in Figure 1-7 also demonstrates a function called adjacent-layer interaction, which refers to the concepts of how adjacent layers in a networking model, on the same computer, work together.  In this example, the higher-layer protocol (HTTP) wants error recovery, and the higher layer uses the next lower-layer protocol (TCP) to perform the service of error recovery; the lower layer provides a service to the layer above it.  Figure 1-7 also shows an example of a similar function called same-layer interaction.  When a particular layer on one computer wants to communicate with the same layer on another computer, the two computers use headers to hold the information that they want to communicate.  For example, in Figure 1-7, Larry set the sequence numbers to 1, 2, and 3 so that Bob could notice when some of the data did not arrive.  Larry’s TCP process created that TCP header with the sequence number; Bob’s TCP process received and reacted to the TCP segments.  Table 1-3 summarizes the key points about how adjacent layers work together on a single computer and how one layer on one computer works with the same networking layer on another computer.  Chapter 1:  to TCP/IP Networking 25 1 Table 1-3 Summary: Same-Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions Concept Description Same-layer interaction on different computers The two computers use a protocol (an agreed-to set of rules) to communicate with the same layer on another computer.

The connection exists between the two sockets, although the TCP header has no single socket field.  Of the three parts of a socket, the IP addresses are implied based on the source and destination IP addresses in the IP header.  TCP is implied because a TCP header is in use, as specified by the protocol field value in the IP header.  Therefore, the only parts of the socket that need to be encoded in the TCP header are the port numbers.  TCP signals connection establishment using 2 bits inside the flag fields of the TCP header.  Called th e SYN and ACK flags, these bits have a particularly interesting meaning.  SYN means “synchronize the sequence numbers,” which is one necessary component in initialization for TCP.  Figure 5-6 shows TCP connection termination.  This four-way termination sequence is straightforward and uses an additional flag, called the FIN bit.  (FIN is short for “finished,” as you might guess.)  One interesting note: Before the device on the right sends the third TCP segment in the sequence, it notifies the application that the connection is coming down.  It then waits on an acknowledgment from the application before sending the third segment in the figure.  Just in case the application takes some time to reply, the PC on the right sends the second flow in the figure, acknowledging that the other PC wants to take down the connection.  Otherwise, the PC on the left might resend the first segment repeatedly.

      "Many protocols operate under these same concepts, so the terms connection-oriented and connectionless are used to refer to the general idea of each.  More formally, these terms can be defined as follows : ■ Connection-oriented protocol: A protocol that requires an exchange of messages before data transfer begins, or that has a required pre-established correlation between two endpoints.  ■ Connectionless protocol: A protocol that does not require an exchange of messages and that does not require a pre-established correlation between two endpoints.  Error Recovery and Reliability TCP provides for reliable data transfer, which is also called reliability or error recovery, depending on what document you read.  To accomplish reliability, TCP numbers data bytes using the Sequence and Acknowledgment fields in the TCP header.  TCP achieves reliability in both directions, using the Sequence Number field of one direction combined with the Acknowledgment field in the opposite direction.  Figure 5-7 shows an example of how the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields allow the PC to send 3000 bytes of data to the server, with the server acknowledging receipt of the data.  The TCP segments in the figure occur in order, from top to bottom.  For simplicity’s sake, all messages happen to have 1000 bytes of data in the data portion of the TCP segment.  The first Sequence number is a nice round number (1000), again for simplicity’s sake.  The top of the figure shows three segments, with each sequence number being 1000 more than the previous, identifying the first of the 1000 bytes in the message.  (That is, in this example, the first segment holds bytes 1000–1999; the second holds bytes 2000–2999; and the third holds bytes 3000–3999.)  1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 1000 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 2000 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 3000 No Data, Acknowledgment = 4000 Got All 3000 Bytes.

      "A web browser, which is software installed on an end user’s computer, provides the means to connect to a web server and display the web pages stored on the web server.  NOTE Although most people use the term web browser, or simply browser, web browsers are also called web clients, because they obtain a service from a web server.  For this process to work, several specific application layer functions must occur.  The user must somehow identify the server, the specific web page, and the protocol used to get the data from the server.  The client must find the server’s IP address, based on the server’s name, typically using DNS.  The client must request the web page, which actually consists of multiple separate files, and the server must send the files to the web browser.  Finally, for electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications, the transfer of data, particularly sensitive financial data, needs to be secure.  The following sections address each of these functions.  Uniform Resource Identifiers For a browser to display a web page, the browser must identify the server that has the web page, plus other information that identifies the particular web page.  Most web servers have many web pages.  For example, if you use a web browser to browse www.cisco.com and you http://www.cisco.com   115 5 click around that web page, you’ll see another web page.  Click again, and you’ll see another web page.  In each case, the clicking action identifies the server’s IP address as well as the specific web page, with the details mostly hidden from you.  (These clickable items on a web page, which in turn bring you to another web page, are called links.)  The browser user can identify a web page when you click something on a web page or when you enter a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in the browser’s address area.  Both options— clicking a link and typing a URI—refer to a URI, because when you click a link on a web page, that link actually refers to a URI.  NOTE Most browsers support some way to view the hidden URI referenced by a link.  In several browsers, hover the mouse pointer over a link, right-click, and select Properties. \n",

How the Receiving Host Identifies the Correct Receiving Application This chapter closes with a discussion that pulls several concepts together from several chapters in Part I of this book.  The concept revolves around the process by which a host, when receiving any message over any network, can decide which of its many application programs should process the received data.  As an example, consider host A shown on the left side of Figure 5-14.  The host happens to have three different web browser windows open, each using a unique TCP port.

For example, an IP packet can indeed have a TCP header after the IP header, an HTTP header after the TCP header, and data for a web page after the HTTP header.  However, when discussing IP, you probably just care about the IP header, so everything after the IP header is just called data.

      "TCP/IP Original Link Application Transport Internet TCP/IP Updated Application Transport Network Data Link Physical Encapsulation, Addressing Bit Transmission Figure 1-12 Link Versus Data Link and Physical Layers Data Encapsulation Terminology As you can see from the explanations of how HTTP, TCP, IP, and Ethernet do their jobs, each layer adds its own header (and for data-link protocols, also a trailer) to the data supplied by the higher layer.  The term encapsulation refers to the process of putting headers (and sometimes trailers) around some data.  Chapter 1:  to TCP/IP Networking 31 1 Many of the examples in this chapter show the encapsulation process.  For example, web server Larry encapsulated the contents of the home page inside an HTTP header in Figure 1-6.  The TCP layer encapsulated the HTTP headers and data inside a TCP header in Figure 1-7.  IP encapsulated the TCP headers and the data inside an IP header in Figure 1-10.  Finally, the Ethernet link layer encapsulated the IP packets inside both a header and a trailer in Figure 1-11.  The process by which a TCP/IP host sends data can be viewed as a five-step process.  The first four steps relate to the encapsulation performed by the four TCP/IP layers, and the last step is the actual physical transmission of the data by the host.  In fact, if you use the five-layer TCP/IP model, one step corresponds to the role of each layer.  The steps are summarized in the following list: Step 1.  Create and encapsulate the application data with any required application layer headers.  For example, the HTTP OK message can be returned in an HTTP header, followed by part of the contents of a web page.  Step 2.  Encapsulate the data supplied by the application layer inside a transport layer header.  For end-user applications, a TCP or UDP header is typically used.  Step 3.  Encapsulate the data supplied by the transport layer inside a network layer (IP) header. \n",

      "IP routing protocol: A protocol that aids routers by dynamically learning about the IP address groups so that a router knows where to route IP packets so that they go to the right destination host.  Other utilities: The network layer also relies on other utilities.  For TCP/IP, these utilities include Domain Name System (DNS), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and ping.  Note that all these functions have variations both for the well-established IP version 4 (IPv4) and for the emerging newer IP version 6 (IPv6).  This chapter focuses on IPv4 and the related protocols.  Part VIII of this book looks at the same kinds of functions for IPv6.  Overview of Network Layer Functions Many protocol models have existed over the years, but today the TCP/IP model dominates.  And at the network layer of TCP/IP, two options exist for the main protocol around which all other network layer functions revolve: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6).  Both IPv4 and IPv6 define the same kinds of network layer functions, but with different details.  This chapter introduces these network layer functions for IPv4, leaving the IPv6 details until Part VIII of this book.  NOTE All references to IP in this chapter refer to the older and more established IPv4.  IP focuses on the job of routing data, in the form of IP packets, from the source host to the destination host.  IP does not concern itself with the physical transmission of data, instead relying on the lower TCP/IP layers to do the physical transmission of the data.  Instead, IP concerns itself with the logical details, rather than physical details, of delivering data.  In particular, the network layer specifies how packets travel end to end over a TCP/IP network, even when the packet crosses many different types of LAN and WAN links.  This first section of the chapter begins a broad discussion of the TCP/IP network layer by looking at IP routing and addressing.  The two topics work together, because IP routing relies on the structure and meaning of IP addresses, and IP addressing was designed with IP routing in mind. \n",

Like the TCP/IP network (Internet) layer, this layer defines logical addressing, routing (forwarding), and the routing protocols used to learn routes.  2 Data link layer.  Like the TCP/IP data link layer, this layer defines the protocols for delivering data over a particular single type of physical network (for example, the Ethernet data link protocols).  1 Physical layer.  This layer defines the physical characteristics of the transmission medium, including connectors, pins, use of pins, electrical currents, encoding, light modulation, and so on. \n",

      "A person writing a letter does not have to think about how the postal service will deliver a letter across the country.  The postal worker in the middle of the country does not have to worry about the contents of the letter.  Likewise, networking models that divide functions into different layers enable one software package or hardware device to implement functions from one layer, and assume that other software/ hardware will perform the functions defined by the other layers.  The following list summarizes the benefits of layered protocol specifications: ■ Less complex: Compared to not using a layered model, network models break the concepts into smaller parts.  ■ Standard interfaces: The standard interface definitions between each layer allow multiple vendors to create products that fill a particular role, with all the benefits of open competition.  ■ Easier to learn: Humans can more easily discuss and learn about the many details of a protocol specification.  ■ Easier to develop: Reduced complexity allows easier program changes and faster product development.  ■ Multivendor interoperability: Creating products to meet the same networking standards means that computers and networking gear from multiple vendors can work in the same network.  ■ Modular engineering: One vendor can write software that implements higher layers—for example, a web browser—and another vendor can write software that implements the lower layers—for example, Microsoft’s built-in TCP/IP software in its operating systems.  OSI Encapsulation Terminology Like TCP/IP, each OSI layer asks for services from the next lower layer.  To provide the services, each layer makes use of a header and possibly a trailer.  The lower layer encapsulates the higher layer’s data behind a header.  OSI uses a more generic term to refer to messages, rather than frame, packet, and segment.  OSI uses the term protocol data unit (PDU).  A PDU represents the bits that include the headers and trailers for that layer, as well as the encapsulated data.  For example, an IP packet, as shown in Figure 1-14, using OSI terminology, is a PDU, more specifically a Layer 3 PDU (abbreviated L3PDU) because IP is a Layer 3 protocol. \n",

To connect to the LAN, the router simply uses an Ethernet LAN interface and an Ethernet cable, as shown on the lower right of Figure 2-3.  The rest of this chapter focuses on Ethernet in particular.  The Variety of Ethernet Physical Layer Standards The term Ethernet refers to an entire family of standards.  Some standards define the specifics of how to send data over a particular type of cabling, and at a particular speed.  Other standards define protocols, or rules, that the Ethernet nodes must follow to be a part of an Ethernet LAN.  All these Ethernet standards come from the IEEE and include the number 802.3 as the beginning part of the standard name.  Ethernet supports a large variety of options for physical Ethernet links given its long history over the last 40 or so years.  Today, Ethernet includes many standards for different kinds of optical and copper cabling, and for speeds from 10 megabits per second (Mbps) up to 100 gigabits per second (Gbps).  The standards also differ as far as the types of cabling and the allowed length of the cabling.  The most fundamental cabling choice has to do with the materials used inside the cable for the physical transmission of bits: either copper wires or glass fibers.  The use of unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling saves money compared to optical fibers, with Ethernet nodes using the wires inside the cable to send data over electrical circuits. \n",

They all have the same 100-meter UTP cable length restriction.  They all use UTP cabling.  However, not all UTP cabling meets the same quality standard, and as it turns out, the faster the Ethernet standard, the higher the required cable quality category needed to support that standard.  As a result, some buildings might have better cabling that supports speeds up through Gigabit Ethernet, whereas some buildings may support only Fast Ethernet.

      "UTP Cabling Pinouts for 1000BASE-T 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet) differs from 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T as far as the cabling and pinouts.  First, 1000BASE-T requires four wire pairs.  Second, it uses more advanced electronics that allow both ends to transmit and receive simultaneously on each wire pair.  However, the wiring pinouts for 1000BASE-T work almost identically to the earlier standards, adding details for the additional two pairs.  The straight-through cable connects each pin with the same numbered pin on the other side, but it does so for all eight pins—pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, up through pin 8.  It keeps one pair at pins 1 and 2 and another at pins 3 and 6, just like in the earlier wiring.  It adds a pair at pins 4 and 5 and the final pair at pins 7 and 8 (refer to Figure 2-10).  The Gigabit Ethernet crossover cable crosses the same two-wire pairs as the crossover cable for the other types of Ethernet (the pairs at pins 1,2 and 3,6).  It also crosses the two new pairs as well (the pair at pins 4,5 with the pair at pins 7 ,8).  Sending Data in Ethernet Networks Although physical layer standards vary quite a bit, other parts of the Ethernet standards work the same way, regardless of the type of physical Ethernet link.  Next, this final major section of this chapter looks at several protocols and rules that Ethernet uses regardless of the type of link.  In particular, this section examines the details of the Ethernet data link layer protocol, plus how Ethernet nodes, switches, and hubs forward Ethernet frames through an Ethernet LAN.  Ethernet Data-Link Protocols One of the most significant strengths of the Ethernet family of protocols is that these protocols use the same data-link standard.  In fact, the core parts of the data-link standard date back to the original Ethernet standards. \n",

      "The reason is that the device using half-duplex uses carrier sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD) logic, waiting to send when receiving a frame, believing collisions occur when they physically do not—and actually stopping sending a frame because the switch thinks a collision occurred.  With enough traffic load, the interface could be in a connect state, but it’s extremely inefficient for passing traffic.  To identify duplex mismatch problems, check the duplex setting on each end of the link and watch for incrementing collision and late collision counters, as explained in the next section.  Common Layer 1 Problems on Working Interfaces When the interface reaches the connect (up/up) state, the switch considers the interface to be working.  The switch, of course, tries to use the interface, and at the same time, the switch keeps various interface counters.  These interface counters can help identify problems that can occur even though the interface is in a connect state.  This section explains some of the related concepts and a few of the most common problems.  Whenever the physical transmission has problems, the receiving device might receive a frame whose bits have changed values.  These frames do not pass the error detection logic as implemented in the FCS field in the Ethernet trailer, as covered in Chapter 2.  The receiving device discards the frame and counts it as some kind of input error.  Cisco switches list this error as a CRC error, as highlighted in Example 12-3.  (Cyclic redundancy check [CRC] is a term related to how the frame check sequence [FCS] math detects an error.)  283 12 Example 12-3 Interface Counters for Layer 1 Problems SW1# show interfaces fa0/13 ! \n",

      "Late Collisions: The subset of all collisions that happen after the 64th byte of the frame has been transmitted.  (In a properly working Ethernet LAN, collisions should occur within the first 64 bytes; late collisions today often point to a duplex mismatch.)  Note that many of these counters occur as part of the CSMA/CD process used when half duplex is enabled.  Collisions occur as a normal part of the half-duplex logic imposed by CSMA/CD, so a switch interface with an increasing collisions counter might not even have a problem.  However, one problem, called late collisions, points to the classic duplex mismatch problem.  284  If a LAN design follows cabling guidelines, all collisions should occur by the end of the 64th byte of any frame.  When a switch has already sent 64 bytes of a frame, and the switch receives a frame on that same interface, the switch senses a collision.  In this case, the collision is a late collision, and the switch increments the late collision counter in addition to the usual CSMA/CD actions to send a jam signal, wait a random time, and try again.  With a duplex mismatch, like the mismatch between SW1 and SW2 in Figure 12-3, the halfduplex interface will likely see the late collisions counter increment.  Why?  The half-duplex interface sends a frame (SW1), but the full duplex neighbor (SW2) sends at any time, even after the 64th byte of the frame sent by the half-duplex switch.  So, just keep repeating the show interfaces command, and if you see the late collisions counter incrementing on a halfduplex interface, you might have a duplex mismatch problem.  A working interface (in an up/up state) can still suffer from issues related to the physical cabling as well.  The cabling problems might not be bad enough to cause a complete failure, but the transmission failures result in some frames failing to pass successfully over the cable.  For example, excessive interference on the cable can cause the various input error counters to keep growing larger, especially the CRC counter. \n",

Thankfully, you do not have to decide now.  In fact, you can study the entire ICND1 book and all the while ponder whether to use the one-exam or two-exam path to CCNA R&S.  At that point, you can make a better decision about which path works better for you.

The only question is when to read each part of the two books.  You have two reasonable options when going with the one-exam option: ■ Complete all the ICND1 book, then move on to the ICND2 book.  ■ Move back and forth between the ICND1 and ICND2 books, by part, based on topics, as shown in Figure 5.  The first option is pretty obvious, but the second one is less obvious.  Figure 5 shows a study plan in which you complete the Ethernet parts in the ICND1, then the Ethernet part in ICND2.  Similarly, you complete the IPv4 parts in ICND1, then ICND2, and then the IPv6 part in both books, and then the final part in both books. \n",

      "How Network Layer Routing Uses LANs and WANs While the network layer routing logic ignores the physical transmission details, the bits still have to be transmitted.  To do that work, the network layer logic in a host or router must hand off the packet to the data link layer protocols, which, in turn, ask the physical layer to actually send the data.  And as was described in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” the data link layer adds the appropriate header and trailer to the packet, creating a frame, before sending the frames over each physical network.  The routing process forwards the network layer packet from end to end through the network, while each data-link frame only takes a smaller part of the trip.  Each successive data link layer frame moves the packet to the next device that thinks about network layer logic.  In short, the network layer thinks about the bigger view of the goal, like “Send this packet to the specified next device...,” while the data link layer thinks about the specifics, like “Encapsulate the packet in a data-link frame and transmit it.” Figure 4-2 points out the key encapsulation logic on each device, using the same examples as shown in Figure 4-1.  84  EoMPLS 10.1.1.1 Eth Encapsulate IP Packet in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in HDLC Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in New Ethernet HDLC Eth Eth Eth HDLC Eth Eth IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet R1 R2 R3 PC1 168.1.1.1 PC2 Serial (HDLC) Figure 4-2 Network Layer and Data Link Layer Encapsulation Because the routers build new data-link headers and trailers, and because the new headers contain data-link addresses, the PCs and routers must have some way to decide what datalink addresses to use.  An example of how the router determines which data-link address to use is the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  ARP dynamically learns the data-link address of an IP host connected to a LAN. \n",

All Ethernet frames have both a destination and source MAC address.  Both are 6-bytes long (represented as 12 hex digits in the book), and are a key part of the switching logic discussed in this section.  Refer back to Chapter 2’s discussion of the header in detail for more info on the rest of the Ethernet frame.  NOTE The companion DVD and website include a video that explains the basics of Ethernet switching.  Now on to the details of how Ethernet switching works!  Forwarding Known Unicast Frames To decide whether to forward a frame, a switch uses a dynamically built table that lists MAC addresses and outgoing interfaces.  Switches compare the frame’s destination MAC address to this table to decide whether the switch should forward a frame or simply ignore it.

The address ends with the interface ID, which acts like the IPv4 host field.  The subnet field sits between the two other fields, used as a way to number and identify subnets, much like the subnet field in IPv4 addresses.  Global Routing Prefix Interface IDSubnet P Bits I BitsS Bits Set by Local Engineer Set By IANA, RIR, or ISP P + S + I = 128 Figure 29-9 Structure of Subnetted IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses First, just think about the general idea with IPv6, comparing Figure 29-9 to Figure 29-8.  The IPv6 global routing prefix acts like the IPv4 network part of the address structure.  The IPv6  698  subnet part acts like the IPv4 subnet part.  And the right side of the IPv6, formally called the interface ID (short for interface identifier), acts like the IPv4 host field.  Now focus on the IPv6 global routing prefix and its prefix length.  Unlike IPv4, IPv6 has no concept of address classes, so no preset rules determine the prefix length of the global routing prefix.  However, when a company applies to an ISP, RIR, or any other organization that can allocate a global routing prefix, that allocation includes both the prefix, and the prefix length.  After a company receives a global routing prefix and that prefix length, the length of the prefix typically does not change over time, and is basically locked.  (Note that the prefix length of the global routing prefix is often between /32 and /48, or possibly as long as /56.)  Next, look to the right side of Figure 29-9 to the interface ID field.  For several reasons that become more obvious the more you learn about IPv6, this field is often 64 bits long.  Does it have to be 64 bits long?  No.  However, using a 64-bit interface ID field works well in real networks, and there are no reasons to avoid using a 64-bit interface ID field. \n",

      "IPv6 Addressing Formats and Conventions The CCENT and CCNA R&S exams require some fundamental skills in working with IPv4 addresses.  For example, you need to be able to interpret IPv4 addresses, like 172.21.73.14.  You need to be able to work with prefix-style masks, like /25, and interpret what that means when used with a particular IPv4 address.  And you need to be able to take an address and mask, like 172.21.73.14/25, and find the subnet ID.  This second major section of this chapter discusses these same ideas for IPv6 addresses.  In particular, this section looks at ■ How to write and interpret unabbreviated 32-digit IPv6 addresses ■ How to abbreviate IPv6 addresses, and how to interpret abbreviated addresses ■ How to interpret the IPv6 prefix length mask ■ How to find the IPv6 prefix (subnet ID), based on an address and prefix length mask The biggest challenge with these tasks lies in the sheer size of the numbers.  Thankfully, the math to find the subnet ID—often a challenge for IPv4—is easier for IPv6, at least to the depth discussed in this book.  Representing Full (Unabbreviated) IPv6 Addresses IPv6 uses a convenient hexadecimal (hex) format for addresses.  To make it more readable, IPv6 uses a format with eight sets of four hex digits, with each set of four digits separated by a colon.  For example: 2340:1111:AAAA:0001:1234:5678:9ABC:1234 NOTE For convenience, the author uses the term quartet for one set of four hex digits, with eight quartets in each IPv6 address.  Note that the IPv6 RFCs do not use the term quartet.  IPv6 addresses also have a binary format as well, but thankfully, most of the time you do not need to look at the binary version of the addresses.  However, in those cases, converting from hex to binary is relatively easy.  Just change each hex digit to the equivalent 4-bit value listed in Table 28-3 . \n",

      "So, this section breaks down two general cases: (a) when 9–16 subnet bits exist, which means that the subnet field exists in only two octets, and (b) cases with 17 or more subnet bits, which means that the subnet field exists in three octets.  Process with 9–16 Subnet Bits To understand the process, you need to know a few terms that the process will use.

For the purposes of the process, the rightmost of these octets is the interesting octet, and the octet just to the left is the cleverly named just-left octet.  The updated process, which makes adjustments for cases in which the subnet field is longer than 1 octet, tells you to count in increments of the magic number in the interesting octet, but count by 1s in the just-left octet.  Formally: Step 1.  Calculate subnet IDs using the 8-subnet-bits-or-less process.  However, when the total adds up to 256, move to the next step; consider the subnet IDs listed so far as a subnet block.  Step 2.  Copy the previous subnet block, but add 1 to the just-left octet in all subnet IDs in the new block.  Step 3.  Repeat Step 2 until you create the block with a just-left octet of 255, but go no further. \n",

      "How Network Layer Routing Uses LANs and WANs While the network layer routing logic ignores the physical transmission details, the bits still have to be transmitted.  To do that work, the network layer logic in a host or router must hand off the packet to the data link layer protocols, which, in turn, ask the physical layer to actually send the data.  And as was described in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” the data link layer adds the appropriate header and trailer to the packet, creating a frame, before sending the frames over each physical network.  The routing process forwards the network layer packet from end to end through the network, while each data-link frame only takes a smaller part of the trip.  Each successive data link layer frame moves the packet to the next device that thinks about network layer logic.  In short, the network layer thinks about the bigger view of the goal, like “Send this packet to the specified next device...,” while the data link layer thinks about the specifics, like “Encapsulate the packet in a data-link frame and transmit it.” Figure 4-2 points out the key encapsulation logic on each device, using the same examples as shown in Figure 4-1.  84  EoMPLS 10.1.1.1 Eth Encapsulate IP Packet in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in HDLC Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in New Ethernet HDLC Eth Eth Eth HDLC Eth Eth IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet R1 R2 R3 PC1 168.1.1.1 PC2 Serial (HDLC) Figure 4-2 Network Layer and Data Link Layer Encapsulation Because the routers build new data-link headers and trailers, and because the new headers contain data-link addresses, the PCs and routers must have some way to decide what datalink addresses to use.  An example of how the router determines which data-link address to use is the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  ARP dynamically learns the data-link address of an IP host connected to a LAN. \n",

      "Honestly, I could have put this topic in several chapters.  The main reason it is here is that you have already seen the IP broadcast addresses in action, including the 255.255.255.255 local broadcast as shown in this chapter.  Review of Unicast (Class A, B, and C) IP Addresses Unicast IP addresses are those Class A, B, and C IP addresses assigned to hosts, router interfaces, and other networking devices.  Because most discussions about IP addressing refer to unicast IP addresses, most of us just refer to them as IP addresses, and leave out the word unicast.  Just to be complete and define the concept, unicast addresses identify one interface on one device to IP.  Just like your postal address gives the post office an address to use to send letters to your one specific house or apartment, a unicast IP address gives the IP network an address to use to send packets to one specific host.  However, with IP, instead of addressing the device, unicast addresses identify individual interfaces.  For example: ■ A router with four LAN interfaces, and two WAN interfaces, have six unicast addresses, each in a different subnet, one for each interface.  ■ A PC with both an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) and a wireless NIC would have two unicast IPv4 addresses, one for each interface .  IP Broadcast Addresses Broadcast IPv4 addresses give IP a way to send one packet that the network delivers to multiple hosts.  IPv4 defines several types of broadcast addresses, with each type being used to reach a different set of hosts.  These different broadcast IP addresses give different overhead protocols like DHCP the ability to efficiently reach all hosts in a specific part of the network.  The following list reviews the three IP broadcast address types: Local broadcast address : 255.255.255.255.  Used to send a packet on a local subnet, knowing that routers will not forward the packet as is.  Also called a limited broadcast. \n",

      "Ethernet Addressing The source and destination Ethernet address fields play a huge role in how Ethernet LANs work.  The general idea for each is relatively simple: The sending node puts its own address in the source address field and the intended Ethernet destination device’s address in the destination address field.  The sender transmits the frame, expecting that the Ethernet LAN, as a whole, will deliver the frame to that correct destination.  Ethernet addresses, also called Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, are 6-byte-long (48-bitlong) binary numbers.  For convenience, most computers list MAC addresses as 12-digit hexadecimal numbers.  Cisco devices typically add some periods to the number for easier readability as well; for example, a Cisco switch might list a MAC address as 0000.0C12.3456.  53 2 Most MAC addresses represent a single NIC or other Ethernet port, so these addresses are often called a unicast Ethernet address.  The term unicast is simply a formal way to refer to the fact that the address represents one interface to the Ethernet LAN.  (This term also contrasts with two other types of Ethernet addresses, broadcast and multicast, which will be defined later in this section.)  The entire idea of sending data to a destination unicast MAC address works well, but it works only if all the unicast MAC addresses are unique.  If two NICs tried to use the same MAC address, there could be confusion.  (The problem would be like the confusion caused to the postal service if you and I both tried to use the same mailing address—would the postal service deliver mail to your house or mine?)  If two PCs on the same Ethernet tried to use the same MAC address, to which PC should frames sent to that MAC address be delivered?  Ethernet solves this problem using an administrative process so that, at the time of manufacture, all Ethernet devices are assigned a universally unique MAC address.  Before a manufacturer can build Ethernet products, it must ask the IEEE to assign the manufacturer a universally unique 3-byte code, called the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). \n",

Leased-Line Cabling To create a leased line, some physical path must exist between the two routers on the ends of the link.  The physical cabling must leave the buildings where each router sits.  However, the telco does not simply install one cable between the two buildings.  Instead, it uses what is typically a large and complex network that creates the appearance of a cable between the two routers.  Figure 3-3 gives a little insight into the cabling that could exist inside the telco for a short leased line.  Telcos put their equipment in buildings called central offices (CO).  The telco installs cables from the CO to most every other building in the city, expecting to sell services to the people in those buildings one day.  The telco would then configure its switches to use some of the capacity on each cable to send data in both directions, creating the equivalent of a crossover cable between the two routers. \n",

First, each site has customer premises equipment (CPE), which includes the router, serial interface card, and CSU/DSU.  Each router uses a serial interface card that acts somewhat like an Ethernet NIC, sending and receiving data over the physical link.  The physical link requires a function called a channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU).  The CSU/DSU can either be integrated into the serial interface card in the router or sit outside the router as an external device.  Figure 3-4 shows the CPE devices, along with the cabling.

(Many cable options exist; the cable just needs to match the connector of the serial interface on one end and the CSU/DSU on the other end.)

      "NOTE While DSL and cable are popular with consumers, many businesses use these technologies for Internet access.  All three of the Internet access technologies in Figure 3-14 happen to use a pair of routers: one at the customer side of the WAN link and one at the ISP side.  The routers will continue to think about network layer logic, of sending IP packets to their destination by forwarding the packets to the next router.  However, the physical and data link layer details on the WAN link differ as compared to leased lines.  The next few pages examine both DSL and cable Internet to show some of those differences.  Digital Subscriber Line Digital subscriber line (DSL) creates a relatively short (miles long, not tens of miles) highspeed link WAN between a telco customer and an ISP.  To do so, it uses the same single-pair telephone line used for a typical home phone line.  DSL, as a technology, does not try to replace leased lines, which run between any two sites, for potentially very long distances.  DSL instead just provides a short physical link from a home to the telco’s network, allowing access to the Internet.  First, to get an idea about the cabling, think about typical home telephone service in the United States, before adding DSL service.  Each home has one phone line that runs from a nearby telco CO to the home.  As shown on the left side of Figure 3-15, the telephone wiring splits out and terminates at several wall plates, often with RJ-11 ports that are a slightly skinnier cousin of the RJ-45 connector.  75 3Home Telco CO Splitter Telephone Line Voice Switch PSTN Figure 3-15 Typical Voice Cabling Concepts in the United States Next, think about the telephone line and the equipment at the CO.  Sometime in the past, the telco installed all the telephone lines from its local CO to each neighborhood, apartment, and so on.  At the CO, each line connects to a port on a telco switch.  This switch supports the ability to set up voice calls, take them down, and forward the voice through the worldwide voice network, called the public switched telephone network, or PSTN. \n",

      "Any time an engineer thinks about what routing protocol to use, he can make some basic comparisons between the routing protocols.  The following list describes four of the major comparison points when comparing these routing protocols: ■ The underlying routing protocol algorithm: Specifically, whether the routing protocol uses logic referenced as distance vector (DV) or link state (LS).  ■ The usefulness of the metric: The routing protocol chooses which route is best based on its metric; so the better the metric, the better the choices made by that routing protocol.  ■ The speed of convergence: How long does it take all the routers to learn about a change in the network and update their IPv4 routing tables?  That concept, called convergence time, varies depending on the routing protocol.  ■ Whether the protocol is a public standard or a vendor-proprietary function: RIP and OSPF happen to be standards, defined by RFCs.  EIGRP happens to be defined by Cisco, and until 2013, was kept private.  RIP’s hop count metric treats each router as a hop, so the hop count is the number of other routers between a router and some remote subnet.  RIP’s hop-count metric means that RIP picks the route with the smallest number of links and routers.  However, that shortest route may have the slowest links.  In fact, Figure 19-2 shows just such a case on the left, with RIP choosing the one-hop route from Router B to subnet 10.1.1.0, even though it crosses the slower 100-Mbps link instead of the two-hop route over two 1-Gbps links.  A routing protocol whose metric was based (at least in part) on link bandwidth might be a better choice in the topology shown in Figure 19-2.  For example, EIGRP does base its metric in part on link bandwidth.  EIGRP, on the right side of the figure, chooses the route that happens to have more links through the network (and more hops), but both links have a faster bandwidth of 1 Gbps on each link . \n",

The ICND2 book’s chapters about OSPF describe link state logic, and the ICND2 book’s chapters on EIGRP get into more detail about some advanced distance vector features.  The Concept of a Distance and a Vector The term distance vector describes what a router knows about each route.  When a router learns about a route to a subnet, the routers learn three important facts related to each route: the destination subnet, the distance (that is, the routing protocol metric), and the vector (that is, the link and next-hop router to use as part of that route).  Figure 19-3 begins to develop that concept showing RIP updates in the small boxes on the left.  That is, Router R1 receives RIP updates from three neighboring routers.  Each update describes a different route for subnet X, with a different metric.  The fact that a particular router sends the RIP message identifies the next-hop router for the route. \n",

      "By wasting fewer addresses, more space remains to allocate more subnets.  VLSM can be helpful for both public and private IP addresses, but the benefits are more dramatic with public networks.  With public networks, the address savings help engineers avoid having to obtain another registered IP network number from regional IP address assignment authorities.  With private networks, as defined in RFC 1918, running out of addresses is not as big a negative, because you can always grab another private network from RFC 1918 if you run out.  Classless and Classful Routing Protocols Before you can deploy a VLSM design, you must first use a routing protocol that supports VLSM.  To support VLSM, the routing protocol must advertise the mask along with each subnet.  Without mask information, the router receiving the update would be confused.  For example, if a router learned a route for 10.1.8.0, but with no mask information, what does that mean?  Is that subnet 10.1.8.0/24?  10.1.8.0/23?  10.1.8.0/30?  The dotted-decimal number 10.1.8.0 happens to be a valid subnet number with a variety of masks, and because multiple masks can be used with VLSM, the router has no good way to make an educated guess.  To effectively support VLSM, the routing protocol needs to advertise the correct mask along with each subnet so that the receiving router knows the exact subnet that is being advertised.  By definition, classless routing protocols advertise the mask with each advertised route, and classful routing protocols do not.  The classless routing protocols, as noted in Table 22-2, are the newer, more advanced routing protocols.  Not only do these more advanced classless routing protocols support VLSM, but they also support manual route summarization, which allows a routing protocol to advertise one route for a larger subnet instead of multiple routes for smaller subnets .

In short, the network layer thinks about the bigger view of the goal, like “Send this packet to the specified next device...,” while the data link layer thinks about the specifics, like “Encapsulate the packet in a data-link frame and transmit it.” Figure 4-2 points out the key encapsulation logic on each device, using the same examples as shown in Figure 4-1.  84  EoMPLS 10.1.1.1 Eth Encapsulate IP Packet in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in HDLC Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in New Ethernet HDLC Eth Eth Eth HDLC Eth Eth IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet R1 R2 R3 PC1 168.1.1.1 PC2 Serial (HDLC) Figure 4-2 Network Layer and Data Link Layer Encapsulation Because the routers build new data-link headers and trailers, and because the new headers contain data-link addresses, the PCs and routers must have some way to decide what datalink addresses to use.  An example of how the router determines which data-link address to use is the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  ARP dynamically learns the data-link address of an IP host connected to a LAN. \n",

However, most SOHO products go by the name router, but happen to include many networking functions in a single device.  Because of that, when learning about networking, it can be difficult to appreciate the different functions the device performs.  To help you understand the features of a router product used in a SOHO environment, Figure 17-4 first shows an example in which the SOHO network uses separate devices for each function.  The first shows the devices and cabling, with a connection to the Internet using cable TV (CATV) as the high-speed Internet service.

Some end-user PCs still connect with cabling to a switch, and the switch still connects to a router’s Ethernet interface.  Other end-user devices use a wireless LAN, with a wireless access point, that also connects to the Ethernet LAN.  For both the wired and wireless devices, the router still provides routing services, forwarding IP packets.  The main differences between the SOHO connection in Figure 17-4 and the enterprise branch in Figure 17-2 relate to the connection into the Internet.  An Internet connection that uses CATV or digital subscriber line (DSL) needs a device that converts between the Layer 1 and 2 standards used on the CATV cable or DSL line and the Ethernet used by the router.  These devices, commonly called cable modems and DSL modems, respectively, convert between CATV Layer 1 and Layer 2 standards to Ethernet, and vice versa.  Similarly, DSL modems convert between the DSL signals over a home telephone line and Ethernet. \n",

      "So the comparison of OSI layers to other protocol models is a general comparison of major goals, and not a comparison of the specific methods.  OSI Layers and Their Functions Today, because most people happen to be much more familiar with TCP/IP functions than with OSI functions, one of the best ways to learn about the function of different OSI layers is to think about the functions in the TCP/IP model and to correlate those with the OSI model.  For the purposes of learning, you can think of five of the OSI layers as doing the same kinds of things as the matching five layers in the TCP/IP model.  For example, the application layer of each model defines protocols to be used directly by the applications, and the physical layer of each defines the electro-mechanical details of communicating over physical connections.  Table 1-4 briefly describes each OSI layer.  34  Table 1-4 OSI Reference Model Layer Descriptions Layer Functional Description 7 Application layer.  Provides an interface from the application to the network by supplying a protocol with actions meaningful to the application, for example, “get web page object.” 6 Presentation layer.  This layer negotiates data formats, such as ASCII text, or image types like JPEG.  5 Session layer.  This layer provides methods to group multiple bidirectional messages into a workflow for easier management and easier backout of work that happened if the entire workflow fails.  4 Transport layer.  In function, much like TCP/IP’s transport layer.  This layer focuses on data delivery between the two endpoint hosts (for example, error recovery).  3 Network layer.  Like the TCP/IP network (Internet) layer, this layer defines logical addressing, routing (forwarding), and the routing protocols used to learn routes.  2 Data link layer.  Like the TCP/IP data link layer, this layer defines the protocols for delivering data over a particular single type of physical network (for example, the Ethernet data link protocols).  1 Physical layer.  This layer defines the physical characteristics of the transmission medium, including connectors, pins, use of pins, electrical currents, encoding, light modulation, and so on. \n",

Note that many network devices must actually understand the protocols at multiple OSI layers, so the layer listed in Table 1-5 actually refers to the highest layer that the device normally thinks about when performing its core work.  For example, routers need to think about Layer 3 concepts, but they must also support features at both Layers 1 and 2.

      "A person writing a letter does not have to think about how the postal service will deliver a letter across the country.  The postal worker in the middle of the country does not have to worry about the contents of the letter.  Likewise, networking models that divide functions into different layers enable one software package or hardware device to implement functions from one layer, and assume that other software/ hardware will perform the functions defined by the other layers.  The following list summarizes the benefits of layered protocol specifications: ■ Less complex: Compared to not using a layered model, network models break the concepts into smaller parts.  ■ Standard interfaces: The standard interface definitions between each layer allow multiple vendors to create products that fill a particular role, with all the benefits of open competition.  ■ Easier to learn: Humans can more easily discuss and learn about the many details of a protocol specification.  ■ Easier to develop: Reduced complexity allows easier program changes and faster product development.  ■ Multivendor interoperability: Creating products to meet the same networking standards means that computers and networking gear from multiple vendors can work in the same network.  ■ Modular engineering: One vendor can write software that implements higher layers—for example, a web browser—and another vendor can write software that implements the lower layers—for example, Microsoft’s built-in TCP/IP software in its operating systems.  OSI Encapsulation Terminology Like TCP/IP, each OSI layer asks for services from the next lower layer.  To provide the services, each layer makes use of a header and possibly a trailer.  The lower layer encapsulates the higher layer’s data behind a header.  OSI uses a more generic term to refer to messages, rather than frame, packet, and segment.  OSI uses the term protocol data unit (PDU).  A PDU represents the bits that include the headers and trailers for that layer, as well as the encapsulated data.  For example, an IP packet, as shown in Figure 1-14, using OSI terminology, is a PDU, more specifically a Layer 3 PDU (abbreviated L3PDU) because IP is a Layer 3 protocol. \n",

And the right side of the IPv6, formally called the interface ID (short for interface identifier), acts like the IPv4 host field.  Now focus on the IPv6 global routing prefix and its prefix length.  Unlike IPv4, IPv6 has no concept of address classes, so no preset rules determine the prefix length of the global routing prefix.  However, when a company applies to an ISP, RIR, or any other organization that can allocate a global routing prefix, that allocation includes both the prefix, and the prefix length.  After a company receives a global routing prefix and that prefix length, the length of the prefix typically does not change over time, and is basically locked.  (Note that the prefix length of the global routing prefix is often between /32 and /48, or possibly as long as /56.)  Next, look to the right side of Figure 29-9 to the interface ID field.  For several reasons that become more obvious the more you learn about IPv6, this field is often 64 bits long.  Does it have to be 64 bits long?  No.  However, using a 64-bit interface ID field works well in real networks, and there are no reasons to avoid using a 64-bit interface ID field. \n",

      "By wasting fewer addresses, more space remains to allocate more subnets.  VLSM can be helpful for both public and private IP addresses, but the benefits are more dramatic with public networks.  With public networks, the address savings help engineers avoid having to obtain another registered IP network number from regional IP address assignment authorities.  With private networks, as defined in RFC 1918, running out of addresses is not as big a negative, because you can always grab another private network from RFC 1918 if you run out.  Classless and Classful Routing Protocols Before you can deploy a VLSM design, you must first use a routing protocol that supports VLSM.  To support VLSM, the routing protocol must advertise the mask along with each subnet.  Without mask information, the router receiving the update would be confused.  For example, if a router learned a route for 10.1.8.0, but with no mask information, what does that mean?  Is that subnet 10.1.8.0/24?  10.1.8.0/23?  10.1.8.0/30?  The dotted-decimal number 10.1.8.0 happens to be a valid subnet number with a variety of masks, and because multiple masks can be used with VLSM, the router has no good way to make an educated guess.  To effectively support VLSM, the routing protocol needs to advertise the correct mask along with each subnet so that the receiving router knows the exact subnet that is being advertised.  By definition, classless routing protocols advertise the mask with each advertised route, and classful routing protocols do not.  The classless routing protocols, as noted in Table 22-2, are the newer, more advanced routing protocols.  Not only do these more advanced classless routing protocols support VLSM, but they also support manual route summarization, which allows a routing protocol to advertise one route for a larger subnet instead of multiple routes for smaller subnets .

Decimal 0, converted to 8-bit binary, is 00000000.  See Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” for a conversion table.  Number of Hosts per Network Calculating the number of hosts per network requires some basic binary math.  First, consider a case where you have a single binary digit.  How many unique values are there?  There are, of course, two values: 0 and 1.  With 2 bits, you can make four combinations: 00, 01, 10, and 11.  As it turns out, the total combination of unique values you can make with N bits is 2N.  Host addresses—the IP addresses assigned to hosts—must be unique.  The host bits exist for the purpose of giving each host a unique IP address by virtue of having a different value in the host part of the addresses.  So, with H host bits, 2H unique combinations exist.  332  However, the number of hosts in a network is not 2H; instead, it is 2H – 2.  Each network reserves two numbers that would have otherwise been useful as host addresses, but have instead been reserved for special use: one for the network ID and one for the network broadcast address.  As a result, the formula to calculate the number of host addresses per Class A, B, or C network is 2H – 2 where H is the number of host bits.  Deriving the Network ID and Related Numbers Each classful network has four key numbers that describe the network.  You can derive these four numbers if you start with just one IP address in the network.  The numbers are as follows: ■ Network number ■ First (numerically lowest) usable address ■ Last (numerically highest) usable address ■ Network broadcast address First, consider both the network number and first usable IP address.  The network number, also called the network ID or network address , identifies the network. \n",

      "By definition, the network number is the numerically lowest number in the network.  However, to prevent any ambiguity, the people that made up IP addressing added the restriction that the network number cannot be assigned as an IP address.  So, the lowest number in the network is the network ID.  Then, the first (numerically lowest) host IP address is one larger than the network number.  Next, consider the network broadcast address along with the last (numerically highest) usable IP address.  The TCP/IP RFCs define a network broadcast address as a special address in each network.  This broadcast address could be used as the destination address in a packet, and the routers would forward a copy of that one packet to all hosts in that classful network.  Numerically, a network broadcast address is always the highest (last) number in the network.  As a result, the highest (last) number usable as an IP address is the address that is simply one less than the network broadcast address.  Simply put, if you can find the network number and network broadcast address, finding the first and last usable IP addresses in the network is easy.  For the exam, you should be able to find all four values with ease; the process is as follows: Step 1.  Determine the class (A, B, or C) based on the first octet.  Step 2.  Mentally divide the network and host octets based on the class.  Step 3.  To find the network number, change the IP address’s host octets to 0.  Step 4.  To find the first address, add 1 to the fourth octet of the network ID.  Step 5.  To find the broadcast address, change the network ID’s host octets to 255.  Step 6.  To find the last address, subtract 1 from the fourth octet of the network broadcast address.  333 14 The written process actually looks harder than it is.

      "575 24 The end of this section turns away from the core IP forwarding logic, looking at other issues that impact packet forwarding, including issues related to router interface status (which needs to be up/up) and how IPv4 access control lists (ACL) can filter IPv4 traffic.  IP Forwarding by Matching the Most Specific Route Any router’s IP routing process requires that the router compare the destination IP address of each packet with the existing contents of that router’s IP routing table.  Often, only one route matches a particular destination address.  However, in some cases, a particular destination address matches more than one of the router’s routes.  The following router features can create overlapping subnets: ■ Autosummarization ■ Manual route summarization ■ Static routes ■ Incorrectly designed subnetting plans that cause subnets to overlap their address ranges In some cases, overlapping routes cause a problem; in other cases, the overlapping routes are just a normal result of using some feature.  This section focuses on how a router chooses which of the overlapping routes to use, for now ignoring whether the overlapping routes are a problem.  The section “Routing Problems Caused by Incorrect Addressing Plans,” later in this chapter, discusses some of the problem cases.  Now on to how a router matches the routing table, even with overlapping routes in its routing table.  If only one route matches a given packet, the router uses that one route.  However, when more than one route matches a packet’s destination address, the router uses the “best” route, defined as follows: When a particular destination IP address matches more than one route in a router’s IPv4 routing table, the router uses the most specific route—in other words, the route with the longest prefix length mask.  Using show ip route and Subnet Math to Find the Best Route We humans have a couple of ways to figure out what choice a router makes for choosing the best route.  One way uses the show ip route command, plus some subnetting math, to decide the route the router will choose.  To let you see how to use this option, Example 24-4 shows a series of overlapping routes . \n",

The Address Resolution Protocol IP routing logic requires that hosts and routers encapsulate IP packets inside data link layer frames.  In fact, Figure 4-11 shows how every router de-encapsulates each IP packet and encapsulates the IP packet inside a new data-link frame.  On Ethernet LANs, whenever a host or router needs to encapsulate an IP packet in a new Ethernet frame, the host or router knows all the important facts to build that header— except for the destination MAC address.  The host knows the IP address of the next device, either another host IP address or the default router IP address.  A router knows the IP route used for forwarding the IP packet, which lists the next router’s IP address.  However, the hosts and routers do not know those neighboring devices’ MAC addresses beforehand.  TCP/IP defines the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as the method by which any host or router on a LAN can dynamically learn the MAC address of another IP host or router on the same LAN.  ARP defines a protocol that includes the ARP Request, which is a message that asks the simple request “if this is your IP address, please reply with your MAC address.” ARP also defines the ARP Reply message, which indeed lists both the original IP address and the matching MAC address.  Figure 4-14 shows an example that uses the same router and host from the bottom part of the earlier Figure 4-11.  The figure shows the ARP Request on the left as a LAN broadcast, so all hosts receive the frame. \n",

      "Larry doesn’t need to know anything more about the topology or the other routers.  At Step 2, Router R1 receives the IP packet, and R1’s IP process makes a decision.  R1 looks at the destination address (2.2.2.2), compares that address to its known IP routes, and chooses to forward the packet to Router R2.  This process of forwarding the IP packet is called IP routing (or simply routing).  At Step 3, Router R2 repeats the same kind of logic used by Router R1.  R2’s IP process will compare the packet’s destination IP address (2.2.2.2) to R2’s known IP routes and make a choice to forward the packet to the right, on to Bob.  You will learn IP to more depth than any other protocol while preparing for CCENT and CCNA.  Practically half the chapters in this book discuss some feature that relates to addressing, IP routing, and how routers perform routing.  TCP/IP Link Layer (Data Link Plus Physical) The TCP/IP model’s original link layer defines the protocols and hardware required to deliver data across some physical network.  The term link refers to the physical connections, or links, between two devices and the protocols used to control those links.  Just like every layer in any networking model, the TCP/IP link layer provides services to the layer above it in the model.  When a host’s or router’s IP process chooses to send an IP packet to another router or host, that host or router then uses link-layer details to send that packet to the next host/router.  Chapter 1:  to TCP/IP Networking 29 1 Because each layer provides a service to the layer above it, take a moment to think about the IP logic related to Figure 1-10.  In that example, host Larry’s IP logic chooses to send the IP packet to a nearby router (R1), with no mention of the underlying Ethernet.  The Ethernet network, which implements link-layer protocols, must then be used to deliver that packet from host Larry over to router R1. \n",

      "The route lists R1’s own Serial0 as the outgoing interface and R2 as the next-hop router IP address (150.150.2.7).  98  Chapter 19, “Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2,” covers routing protocols in more detail.  Next, the final major section of this chapter introduces several additional functions related to how the network layer forwards packets from source to destination through an internetwork.  Other Network Layer Features The TCP/IP network layer defines many functions beyond the function defined by the IPv4 protocol.  Sure, IPv4 plays a huge role in networking today, defining IP addressing and IP routing.  However, other protocols and standards, defined in other Requests For Comments (RFC), play an important role for network layer functions as well.  For example, routing protocols like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) exist as separate protocols, defined in separate RFCs.  This last short section of the chapter introduces three other network layer features that should be helpful to you when reading through the rest of this book.  These last three topics just help fill in a few holes, helping to give you some perspective, and helping you make sense of later discussions as well.  The three topics are ■ Domain Name System (DNS) ■ Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) ■ Ping Using Names and the Domain Name System Can you imagine a world in which every time you used an application, you had to think about the other computer and refer to it by IP address?  Instead of using easy names like google.com or facebook.com, you would have to remember and type IP addresses, like 74.125.225.5.  Certainly, that would not be user friendly and could drive some people away from using computers at all.  Thankfully, TCP/IP defines a way to use hostnames to identify other computers.  The user either never thinks about the other computer or refers to the other computer by name.  Then, protocols dynamically discover all the necessary information to allow communications based on that name. \n",

      "This section examines how to know what behavior will happen when a violation occurs, and how to know if it is happening right now or not.  ■ Analyzing VLANs and VLAN trunking: Keeping a Layer 2 switch focus, this last section looks at what can go wrong with VLANs and VLAN trunks.  Analyzing Switch Interface Status and Statistics This section makes the transition from the process focus of the previous section to the first of four technology-focused sections of this chapter.  That process begins with finding out whether each switch interface works, and if working, whether any statistics reveal any additional problems.  Unsurprisingly, Cisco switches do not use interfaces at all unless the interface is first considered to be in a functional or working state.  In addition, the switch interface might be in a working state, but intermittent problems might still be occurring.  This section begins by looking at the Cisco switch interface status codes and what they mean so that you can know whether an interface is working.  The rest of this section then looks at those more unusual cases in which the interface is working, but not working well, as revealed by different interface status codes and statistics.  Interface Status Codes and Reasons for Nonworking States Cisco switches actually use two different sets of interface status codes—one set of two codes (words) that use the same conventions as do router interface status codes, and another set with a single code (word).  Both sets of status codes can determine whether an interface is working.  The switch show interfaces and show interfaces description commands list the two-code status named the line status and protocol status.  The line status generally refers to whether Layer 1 is working, with protocol status generally referring to whether Layer 2 is working.  NOTE This book refers to these two status codes in shorthand by just listing the two codes with a slash between them, such as up/up.  The single-code interface status corresponds to different combinations of the traditional two-code interface status codes and can be easily correlated to those codes.  For example, the show interfaces status command lists a connected state for working interfaces, with the same meaning as the up/up state seen with the show interfaces and show interfaces description commands.  Table 12-2 lists the code combinations and some root causes that could have caused a particular interface status. \n",

      "By wasting fewer addresses, more space remains to allocate more subnets.  VLSM can be helpful for both public and private IP addresses, but the benefits are more dramatic with public networks.  With public networks, the address savings help engineers avoid having to obtain another registered IP network number from regional IP address assignment authorities.  With private networks, as defined in RFC 1918, running out of addresses is not as big a negative, because you can always grab another private network from RFC 1918 if you run out.  Classless and Classful Routing Protocols Before you can deploy a VLSM design, you must first use a routing protocol that supports VLSM.  To support VLSM, the routing protocol must advertise the mask along with each subnet.  Without mask information, the router receiving the update would be confused.  For example, if a router learned a route for 10.1.8.0, but with no mask information, what does that mean?  Is that subnet 10.1.8.0/24?  10.1.8.0/23?  10.1.8.0/30?  The dotted-decimal number 10.1.8.0 happens to be a valid subnet number with a variety of masks, and because multiple masks can be used with VLSM, the router has no good way to make an educated guess.  To effectively support VLSM, the routing protocol needs to advertise the correct mask along with each subnet so that the receiving router knows the exact subnet that is being advertised.  By definition, classless routing protocols advertise the mask with each advertised route, and classful routing protocols do not.  The classless routing protocols, as noted in Table 22-2, are the newer, more advanced routing protocols.  Not only do these more advanced classless routing protocols support VLSM, but they also support manual route summarization, which allows a routing protocol to advertise one route for a larger subnet instead of multiple routes for smaller subnets .

How the Receiving Host Identifies the Correct Receiving Application This chapter closes with a discussion that pulls several concepts together from several chapters in Part I of this book.  The concept revolves around the process by which a host, when receiving any message over any network, can decide which of its many application programs should process the received data.  As an example, consider host A shown on the left side of Figure 5-14.  The host happens to have three different web browser windows open, each using a unique TCP port.

For instance, if the destination TCP port value in Figure 5-15 is 1024, host A will know that the data is meant for the first of the three web browser windows.  Before a receiving host can even examine the TCP or UDP header, and find the destination port field, it must first process the outer headers in the message.  If the incoming message is an Ethernet frame, that encapsulates an IPv4 packet, the headers look like the details in Figure 5-15. \n",

      "How Network Layer Routing Uses LANs and WANs While the network layer routing logic ignores the physical transmission details, the bits still have to be transmitted.  To do that work, the network layer logic in a host or router must hand off the packet to the data link layer protocols, which, in turn, ask the physical layer to actually send the data.  And as was described in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” the data link layer adds the appropriate header and trailer to the packet, creating a frame, before sending the frames over each physical network.  The routing process forwards the network layer packet from end to end through the network, while each data-link frame only takes a smaller part of the trip.  Each successive data link layer frame moves the packet to the next device that thinks about network layer logic.  In short, the network layer thinks about the bigger view of the goal, like “Send this packet to the specified next device...,” while the data link layer thinks about the specifics, like “Encapsulate the packet in a data-link frame and transmit it.” Figure 4-2 points out the key encapsulation logic on each device, using the same examples as shown in Figure 4-1.  84  EoMPLS 10.1.1.1 Eth Encapsulate IP Packet in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in HDLC Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in New Ethernet HDLC Eth Eth Eth HDLC Eth Eth IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet R1 R2 R3 PC1 168.1.1.1 PC2 Serial (HDLC) Figure 4-2 Network Layer and Data Link Layer Encapsulation Because the routers build new data-link headers and trailers, and because the new headers contain data-link addresses, the PCs and routers must have some way to decide what datalink addresses to use.  An example of how the router determines which data-link address to use is the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  ARP dynamically learns the data-link address of an IP host connected to a LAN. \n",

Figure 5-2 Hannah Sending Packets to Jessie, with Three Applications Jessie needs to know which application to give the data to, but all three packets are from the same Ethernet and IP address.  You might think that Jessie could look at whether the packet contains a UDP or TCP header, but as you see in the figure, two applications (wire transfer and web) are using TCP.  107 5 TCP and UDP solve this problem by using a port number field in the TCP or UDP header, respectively.

A socket consists of three things: ■ An IP address ■ A transport protocol ■ A port number So, for a web server application on Jessie, the socket would be (10.1.1.2, TCP, port 80) because, by default, web servers use the well-known port 80.  When Hannah’s web browser connects to the web server, Hannah uses a socket as well—possibly one like this: (10.1.1.1, TCP, 1030).  Why 1030?  Well, Hannah just needs a port number that is unique on Hannah, so Hannah sees that port 1030 is available and uses it.  In fact, hosts typically allocate dynamic port numbers starting at 1024 because the ports below 1024 are reserved for wellknown applications.  In Figure 5-3, Hannah and Jessie use three applications at the same time—hence, three socket connections are open.  Because a socket on a single computer should be unique, a connection between two sockets should identify a unique connection between two computers.  This uniqueness means that you can use multiple applications at the same time, talking to applications running on the same or different computers.  Multiplexing, based on sockets, ensures that the data is delivered to the correct applications.  Figure 5-4 shows the three socket connections between Hannah and Jessie. \n",

Along the way, the text briefly examines each layer of the OSI model.  Describing Protocols by Referencing the OSI Layers Even today , networking documents often describe TCP/IP protocols and standards by referencing OSI layers, both by layer number and layer name.  For example, a common description of a LAN switch is “Layer 2 switch,” with “Layer 2” referring to OSI layer 2.  Because OSI did have a well-defined set of functions associated with each of its seven layers, if you know those functions, you can understand what people mean when they refer to a product or function by its OSI layer.  For another example, TCP/IP’s original Internet layer, as implemented mainly by IP, equates most directly to the OSI network layer.  So, most people say that IP is a network layer protocol, or a Layer 3 protocol, using OSI terminology and numbers for the layer.  Of course, if you numbered the TCP/IP model, starting at the bottom, IP would be either Layer 2 or 3, depending on what version of the TCP/IP model you care to use.  However, even though IP is a TCP/IP protocol, everyone uses the OSI model layer names and numbers when describing IP or any other protocol for that matter.  The claim that a particular TCP/IP layer is similar to a particular OSI layer is a general comparison, but not a detailed comparison.  The comparison is a little like comparing a car to a truck: Both can get you from point A to point B, but they have many specific differences, like the truck having a truck bed in which to carry cargo.  Similarly, both the OSI and TCP/IP network layers define logical addressing and routing.  However, the addresses have a different size, and the routing logic even works differently. \n",

      "They can be used to query, compile, store, and display information about a network’s operation.  To query the network devices, Cisco Prime software mainly uses SNMP protocols.  Traditionally, to move files to and from a router or switch, Cisco used Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) .  TFTP defines a protocol for basic file transfer—hence the word trivial.  Alternatively, routers and switches can use File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is a much more functional protocol, to transfer files.  Both work well for moving files into and out of Cisco devices.  FTP allows many more features, making it a good choice for the general end-user population.  TFTP client and server applications are very simple, making them good tools as embedded parts of networking devices.  Some of these applications use TCP, and some use UDP.  For example, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), both used for transferring mail, require guaranteed delivery, so they use TCP.  Regardless of which transport layer protocol is used, applications use a well-known port number so that clients know which port to attempt to connect to.  Table 5-3 lists several popular applications and their well-known port numbers.

Figure 1-14 also shows the encapsulated data as simply “data.” When focusing on the work done by a particular layer, the encapsulated data typically is unimportant.  For example, an IP packet can indeed have a TCP header after the IP header, an HTTP header after the TCP header, and data for a web page after the HTTP header.  However, when discussing IP, you probably just care about the IP header, so everything after the IP header is just called data.  So, when drawing IP packets, everything after the IP header is typically shown simply as data. \n",

      "TCP/IP Original Link Application Transport Internet TCP/IP Updated Application Transport Network Data Link Physical Encapsulation, Addressing Bit Transmission Figure 1-12 Link Versus Data Link and Physical Layers Data Encapsulation Terminology As you can see from the explanations of how HTTP, TCP, IP, and Ethernet do their jobs, each layer adds its own header (and for data-link protocols, also a trailer) to the data supplied by the higher layer.  The term encapsulation refers to the process of putting headers (and sometimes trailers) around some data.  Chapter 1:  to TCP/IP Networking 31 1 Many of the examples in this chapter show the encapsulation process.  For example, web server Larry encapsulated the contents of the home page inside an HTTP header in Figure 1-6.  The TCP layer encapsulated the HTTP headers and data inside a TCP header in Figure 1-7.  IP encapsulated the TCP headers and the data inside an IP header in Figure 1-10.  Finally, the Ethernet link layer encapsulated the IP packets inside both a header and a trailer in Figure 1-11.  The process by which a TCP/IP host sends data can be viewed as a five-step process.  The first four steps relate to the encapsulation performed by the four TCP/IP layers, and the last step is the actual physical transmission of the data by the host.  In fact, if you use the five-layer TCP/IP model, one step corresponds to the role of each layer.  The steps are summarized in the following list: Step 1.  Create and encapsulate the application data with any required application layer headers.  For example, the HTTP OK message can be returned in an HTTP header, followed by part of the contents of a web page.  Step 2.  Encapsulate the data supplied by the application layer inside a transport layer header.  For end-user applications, a TCP or UDP header is typically used.  Step 3.  Encapsulate the data supplied by the transport layer inside a network layer (IP) header. \n",

      "How Network Layer Routing Uses LANs and WANs While the network layer routing logic ignores the physical transmission details, the bits still have to be transmitted.  To do that work, the network layer logic in a host or router must hand off the packet to the data link layer protocols, which, in turn, ask the physical layer to actually send the data.  And as was described in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” the data link layer adds the appropriate header and trailer to the packet, creating a frame, before sending the frames over each physical network.  The routing process forwards the network layer packet from end to end through the network, while each data-link frame only takes a smaller part of the trip.  Each successive data link layer frame moves the packet to the next device that thinks about network layer logic.  In short, the network layer thinks about the bigger view of the goal, like “Send this packet to the specified next device...,” while the data link layer thinks about the specifics, like “Encapsulate the packet in a data-link frame and transmit it.” Figure 4-2 points out the key encapsulation logic on each device, using the same examples as shown in Figure 4-1.  84  EoMPLS 10.1.1.1 Eth Encapsulate IP Packet in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in HDLC Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in New Ethernet HDLC Eth Eth Eth HDLC Eth Eth IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet R1 R2 R3 PC1 168.1.1.1 PC2 Serial (HDLC) Figure 4-2 Network Layer and Data Link Layer Encapsulation Because the routers build new data-link headers and trailers, and because the new headers contain data-link addresses, the PCs and routers must have some way to decide what datalink addresses to use.  An example of how the router determines which data-link address to use is the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  ARP dynamically learns the data-link address of an IP host connected to a LAN. \n",

      "As covered in the ICND1 book’s Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” the port security feature can be used to cause the switch to discard some frames sent into and out of an interface.  Port security has three basic features with which it determines which frames to filter: ■ Limit which specific MAC addresses can send and receive frames on a switch interface, discarding frames to/from other MAC addresses ■ Limit the number of MAC addresses using the interface, discarding frames to/from MAC addresses learned after the maximum limit is reached ■ A combination of the previous two points The first port security troubleshooting step should be to find which interfaces have port security enabled, followed by a determination as to whether any violations are currently occurring.  The trickiest part relates to the differences in what the IOS does in reaction to violations based on the switchport port-security violation violation-mode interface subcommand, which tells the switch what to do when a violation occurs.  The general process to find port security issues is as follows: Step 1.  Identify all interfaces on which port security is enabled (show running-config or show port-security).  Step 2.  Determine whether a security violation is currently occurring based in part on the violation mode of the interface’s port security configuration, as follows: A. shutdown: The interface will be in an err-disabled state, and the port secu rity port status will be secure-down.  288  B. restrict: The interface will be in a connected state, the port security port status will be secure-up, but the show port-security interface command will show an incrementing violations counter.  C. protect: The interface will be in a connected state, and the show port-security interface command will not show an incrementing violations counter.  Step 3.  In all cases, compare the port security configuration to the diagram and to the Last Source Address field in the output of the show port-security interface command.  Because IOS reacts so differently with shutdown mode as compared to restrict and protect modes, the next few pages explain the differences—first for shutdown mode, then for the other two modes. \n",

      "The first line (line console 0) is the command that identifies the console, basically meaning “these next commands apply to the console only.” The login command tells IOS to perform simple password checking (at the console).  Remember, by default, the switch does not ask for a password for console users.  Finally, the password faith command defines the password the console user must type when prompted.  This example just scratches the surface of the kinds of security configuration you might choose to configure on a switch, but it does give you enough detail to configure switches in your lab and get started (which is the reason I put these details in this first chapter of Part II).  Note that Chapter 8 shows the configuration steps to add support for Telnet and SSH (including password security), and Chapter 34, “Device Security Features,” shows additional security configuration as well.  CLI Help Features If you printed the Cisco IOS Command Reference documents, you would end up with a stack of paper several feet tall.  No one should expect to memorize all the commands—and no one does.  You can use several very easy, convenient tools to help remember commands and save time typing.  As you progress through your Cisco certifications, the exams will cover progressively more commands.  However, you should know the methods of getting command help.  Table 6-2 summarizes command-recall help options available at the CLI.  Note that, in the first column, command represents any command.  Likewise, parm represents a command’s parameter.  For example, the third row lists command ?, which means that commands such as show ?  and copy ?  would list help for the show and copy commands, respectively.

The debug EXEC command gives the network engineer a way to ask IOS to monitor for certain internal events, with that monitoring process continuing over time, so that IOS can issue log messages when those events occur.  The engineer can log in, issue the debug command, and move on to other work.  The user can even log out of the device, and the debug remains enabled.  IOS continues to monitor the request in that debug command and generate log messages about any related events.  The debug remains active until some user issues the no debug command with the same parameters, disabling the debug.  NOTE While the debug command is just one command, it has a huge number of options, much like the show command may be one command, but it also has many, many options.  The best way to see how the debug command works, and how it uses log messages, is to see an example.  Figure 33-4 shows a small network with two routers, both of which happen to use RIPv2.  RIPv2 sends periodic updates every 30 seconds.  In the design shown in Figure 33-4, focus on R2’s advertisement to R1, in which R2 will advertise its route for 172.16.3.0/24 to R1.

Password Security for CLI Access from the Console A Cisco switch, with default settings, remains relatively secure when locked inside a wiring closet, because by default, a switch allows console access only.  By default, the console requires no password at all, and no password to reach enable mode for users that happened to connect from the console.  The reason is that if you have access to the physical console port of the switch, you already have pretty much complete control over the switch. \n",

      "ROMMON contains a small and different set of CLI commands as compared to IOS, with the commands varying from router model to router model.  However, each router’s ROMMON software supports some command, usually the confreg command, that lets you set the configuration register.  For instance, the ROMMON command confreg 0x2142 would set the correct bit to tell the router to ignore the startup-config file at reload.  So, how do you get the router to boot in ROMMON mode?  Older routers require you to press the break key at the console during boot of the router.  Some newer routers happen to have all removable flash memory—on those, just remove the flash (so there is no IOS available), and turn the router off and back on, and the router has no IOS to load—so it loads ROMMON.  (Put the flash back in once ROMMON loads .)  In summary, the big ideas behind password recovery are as follows: Step 1.  Boot ROMMON, either by breaking into the boot process from the console or by first removing all the flash memory.  Step 2.  Set the configuration register to ignore the startup-config file (for example, confreg 0x2142).  Step 3.  Boot the router with an IOS.  The router boots with no configuration.  Now you can reach enable mode from the console without needing any passwords .  837 35 A Specific Password Reset Example Example 35-8 shows a sample password recovery/reset process on a 2901 router.  The example begins with Router R1 powered on and the user connected at the console.  These 2901 routers use compact flash slots for the primary flash memory; in this example, I removed the flash memory and rebooted the router so that the normal boot process caused ROMMON to load.  Look at the highlighted steps in the example for the specific action that resets the password.

      "With access to the router console and the ability to power the router off and back on, anyone can reset all the passwords on the router to new values.  The details differ from router model to router model.  However, if you go to www.cisco.com and search for “password recovery,” within the first few hits you should see a master password http://www.cisco.com  836  recovery page.  This page lists instructions on how to perform password recovery (actually password reset) for almost any model of Cisco product.  NOTE Cisco generally refers to the topic in this section as password recovery, but you do not actually recover and learn the password that you forgot.  Instead, you change the password to a new value.  The General Ideas Behind Cisco Password Recovery/Reset Although the details differ from model to model, all the password recovery procedures follow the same general principles.  First, the end goal of the process is to make the router boot IOS while ignoring the startup-config file.  Of course, this startup configuration holds all the passwords.  Once the router boots while ignoring the initial configuration, the router has no passwords at all, so you can log in at the console with no password restrictions and reconfigure all the passwords.  One config-register bit holds the key: the ignore configuration bit.  (The bit is the second bit in the third nibble, reading left to right.)  When set to binary 1, the router will ignore the startup-config file the next time the router is loaded.  To set that value, the default configuration register value of 0x2102 can be changed to 0x2142.  Unfortunately, under normal circumstances, you need to remember the enable password to reach the mode to configure the configuration register’s value.  When you need to do password recovery, you clearly do not know the passwords, so how can you change the configuration register?  The solution is to use ROMMON mode.  ROMMON enables you to set the configuration register. \n",

      "However, these two commands tell us nothing about the operation state inside the various network devices.  Once you begin to get an idea of the kinds of problems and the possible locations of the problems using ping and traceroute, the next step is to look at the status of various router and switch features.  One way to do that is to use Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH) to log in to the devices.  Common Reasons to Use the IOS Telnet and SSH Client Normally, a network engineer would log in to the remote device using a Telnet or SSH client on their PC, tablet, or any other user device.  In fact, often times, the same software package does both Telnet and SSH.  However, in some cases, you may want to take advantage of the Telnet and SSH client built in to IOS on the routers and switches, to Telnet/SSH from one Cisco device to the next.  To understand why, consider the example shown in Figure 23-17.  The figure shows arrowed lines to three separate IP addresses on three separate Cisco routers.  PC1 has attempted to Telnet to each address from a different tab in PC1’s Telnet/SSH client.  However, R2 happens to have an error in its routing protocol configuration, so R1, R2, and R3 fail to learn any routes from each other.  As a result, PC1’s Telnet attempt to both 10.1.2.2 (R2) and 10.1.3.2 (R3) fails.

Config Checklist   179 8 Two key commands give some information about the status of SSH on the switch.  First, the show ip ssh command lists status information about the SSH server itself.  The show ssh command then lists information about each SSH client currently connected into the switch.  Example 8-6 shows samples of each, with user Wendell currently connected to the switch.  Example 8-6 Displaying SSH Status SW1# show ip ssh SSH Enabled version 2.0 Authentication timeout: 120 secs; Authentication retries: 3 SW1# show ssh Connection Version Mode Encryption Hmac State Username 0 2.0 IN aes128-cbc hmac-sha1 Session started wendell 0 2.0 OUT aes128-cbc hmac-sha1 Session started wendell %No SSHv1 server connections running.  Enabling IPv4 for Remote Access To allow Telnet or SSH access to the switch, and to allow other IP-based management protocols (for example, Simple Network Management Protocol, or SNMP) to function as intended, the switch needs an IP address, as well as a few other related settings.  The IP address has nothing to do with how switches forward Ethernet frames; it simply exists to support overhead management traffic.  This next topic begins by explaining the IPv4 settings needed on a switch, followed by the configuration.  Note that although switches can be configured with IPv6 addresses with commands similar to those shown in this chapter, this chapter focuses solely on IPv4.

      "If the details from Chapter 6 are not fresh in your memory, it might be worthwhile to spend a few minutes briefly reviewing Chapter 6 as well as Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” before reading further.  Cisco switches and routers share many of the same CLI navigation features, and many of the same configuration commands for management features.  ■ Many Cisco router models have an auxiliary (Aux) port, intended to be connected to an external modem and phone line to allow remote users to dial in to the router, and access the CLI, by making a phone call.  Cisco switches do not have auxiliary ports.  ■ Router IOS defaults to disallow both Telnet and SSH into the router because of the default setting of transport input none in vty configuration mode.  Chapter 8, “Configuring Basic Switch Management,” already discussed the various options on this command to enable Telnet (transport input telnet), SSH (transport input ssh), or both (transport input all or transport input telnet ssh).  The router CLI also differs from a switch CLI just because switches and routers do different things.  For example, Cisco Layer 2 switches support the show mac address-table command, but these Layer 2–only devices do not support the show ip route command, which routers use to list IPv4 routes.  Some Cisco routers can do IP routing but not Layer 2 switching, so they support the show ip route command but not the show mac address-table command.  NOTE The book includes a video that shows how to navigate the router CLI; you can find this video on the DVD and on the companion website.  Router Interfaces One minor difference between Cisco switches and routers is that routers support a much wider variety of interfaces.  Today, LAN switches support Ethernet LAN interfaces of various speeds.  Routers support a variety of other types of interfaces, including serial interfaces, cable TV, DSL, 3G/4G wireless, and others not mentioned in this book.  392  Most Cisco routers have at least one Ethernet interface of some type. \n",

      "Conversely, the speed command is an interface subcommand that applies to each switch interface that can run at different speeds, so it is a subcommand, applying to the particular interface under which it is configured.  Storing Switch Configuration Files When you configure a switch, it needs to use the configuration.  It also needs to be able to retain the configuration in case the switch loses power.  Cisco switches contain random-access memory (RAM) to store data while Cisco IOS is using it, but RAM loses its contents when the switch loses power or is reloaded.  To store information that must be retained when the switch loses power or is reloaded, Cisco switches use several types of more permanent memory, none of which has any moving parts.  By avoiding components with moving parts (such as traditional disk drives), switches can maintain better uptime and availability.  The following list details the four main types of memory found in Cisco switches, as well as the most common use of each type: ■ RAM: Sometimes called DRAM, for dynamic random-access memory, RAM is used by the switch just as it is used by any other computer: for working storage.  The running (active) configuration file is stored here.  ■ Flash memory: Either a chip inside the switch or a removable memory card, flash memory stores fully functional Cisco IOS images and is the default location where the switch gets its Cisco IOS at boot time.  Flash memory also can be used to store any other files, including backup copies of configuration files.  ■ ROM: Read-only memory (ROM) stores a bootstrap (or boothelper) program that is loaded when the switch first powers on.  This bootstrap program then finds the full Cisco IOS image and manages the process of loading Cisco IOS into RAM, at which point Cisco IOS takes over operation of the switch.  ■ NVRAM: Nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) stores the initial or startup configuration file that is used when the switch is first powered on and when the switch is reloaded.  Figure 6-9 summarizes this same information in a briefer and more convenient form for memorization and study. \n",

Remember, this process makes the router boot with no initial configuration, so it is clearly disruptive to the normal working state of the router, even beyond the time required to work through the process.  The copy startup-config running-config command makes up for the fact that the router ignored the startup-config file when it booted IOS.  Also, to be ready for the next time the router reloads, put the configuration register value back to its normal permanent value, usually hex 2102.  NOTE When using this process, at the end, take the time to check the interface state of the router interfaces.  The copy running-config startup-config command could result in some of the interfaces remaining in a shutdown state, depending on the current state of the cabling and the state of the connected devices.  So, make sure to check and enable any interfaces with the no shutdown interface subcommand.  839 35 Managing Configuration Files Cisco routers and switches happen to use two different configuration files: a startup-config file to save the configuration to use each time the device boots, and the running-config file that holds the currently used configuration for current use inside RAM. \n",

      "142  RAM (Working Memory and Running Configuration) Flash (Cisco IOS Software) ROM (Bootstrap Program) NVRAM (Startup Configuration) Figure 6-9 Cisco Switch Memory Types Cisco IOS stores the collection of configuration commands in a configuration file.  In fact, switches use multiple configuration files—one file for the initial configuration used when powering on, and another configuration file for the active, currently used running configuration as stored in RAM.  Table 6-5 lists the names of these two files, their purpose, and their storage location .  Table 6-5 Names and Purposes of the Two Main Cisco IOS Configuration Files Configuration Filename Purpose Where It Is Stored startup-config Stores the initial configuration used anytime the switch reloads Cisco IOS.  NVRAM running-config Stores the currently used configuration commands.  This file changes dynamically when someone enters commands in configuration mode.  RAM Essentially, when you use configuration mode, you change only the running-config file.  This means that the configuration example earlier in this chapter (Example 6-4) updates only the running-config file.  However, if the switch lost power right after that example, all that configuration would be lost.  If you want to keep that configuration, you have to copy the running-config file into NVRAM, overwriting the old startup-config file.  Example 6-5 demonstrates that commands used in configuration mode change only the running configuration in RAM.  The example shows the following concepts and steps: Step 1.  The example begins with both the running and startup-config having the same hostname, per the hostname hannah command.  Step 2.

      "142  RAM (Working Memory and Running Configuration) Flash (Cisco IOS Software) ROM (Bootstrap Program) NVRAM (Startup Configuration) Figure 6-9 Cisco Switch Memory Types Cisco IOS stores the collection of configuration commands in a configuration file.  In fact, switches use multiple configuration files—one file for the initial configuration used when powering on, and another configuration file for the active, currently used running configuration as stored in RAM.  Table 6-5 lists the names of these two files, their purpose, and their storage location .  Table 6-5 Names and Purposes of the Two Main Cisco IOS Configuration Files Configuration Filename Purpose Where It Is Stored startup-config Stores the initial configuration used anytime the switch reloads Cisco IOS.  NVRAM running-config Stores the currently used configuration commands.  This file changes dynamically when someone enters commands in configuration mode.  RAM Essentially, when you use configuration mode, you change only the running-config file.  This means that the configuration example earlier in this chapter (Example 6-4) updates only the running-config file.  However, if the switch lost power right after that example, all that configuration would be lost.  If you want to keep that configuration, you have to copy the running-config file into NVRAM, overwriting the old startup-config file.  Example 6-5 demonstrates that commands used in configuration mode change only the running configuration in RAM.  The example shows the following concepts and steps: Step 1.  The example begins with both the running and startup-config having the same hostname, per the hostname hannah command.  Step 2.  The hostname is changed in configuration mode using the hostname jessie command.  Step 3.  The show running-config and show startup-config commands show the fact that the hostnames are now different, with the hostname jessie command found only in the running-config.

Clearly, IOS needs to provide us a way to copy the running configuration so that it will not be lost, so it will be used the next time the switch reloads or powers on.  For instance, Example 6-5 ended with a different running configuration (with the hostname jessie command) versus the startup configuration.  In short, the EXEC command copy running-config startup-config backs up the runningconfig to the startup-config file.  This command overwrites the current startup-config file with what is currently in the running-configuration file.  In addition, in lab, you may want to just get rid of all existing configuration and start over with a clean configuration.  To do that, you can erase the startup-config file using three different commands: write erase erase startup-config erase nvram: Once the startup-config file is erased, you can reload or power off/on the switch, and it will boot with the now-empty startup configuration. \n",

      "Cisco loads flash memory with a single IOS when it builds and tests the router, and the configuration register value is set to 0x2102, meaning a boot field of 0x2.

      "After you predict the expected contents of the MAC address tables, you can then examine what is actually happening on the switches, as described in the next section.  Analyzing the Forwarding Path Troubleshooting revolves around three big ideas: predicting what should happen, determining what is happening that is different than what should happen, and figuring out why that different behavior is happening.  This next section discusses how to look at what is actually happening in a VLAN based on those MAC address tables, first using a summary of switch forwarding logic and then showing an example.  The following list summarizes switch forwarding logic including the LAN switching features discussed in this book: Step 1.  Process functions on the incoming interface, if the interface is currently in an up/up (connected) state, as follows: A.  If configured, apply port security logic to filter the frame as appropriate.  B.  If the port is an access port, determine the interface’s access VLAN.  C. If the port is a trunk, determine the frame’s tagged VLAN.  Step 2.  Make a forwarding decision.  Look for the frame’s destination MAC address in the MAC address table, but only for entries in the VLAN identified in Step 1.  If the destination MAC is… A.  Found (unicast), forward the frame out the only interface listed in the matched address table entry.  B.  Not found (unicast), flood the frame out all other access ports (except the incoming port) in that same VLAN, plus out trunks that have not restricted the VLAN from that trunk (as discussed in Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” as related to the show interfaces trunk command).  C. Broadcast, flood the frame, with the same rules as the previous step.  For an example of this process, consider a frame sent by Barney to its default gateway, R1 (0200.5555.5555).  Using the steps just listed, the following occurs: Step 1.  Input interface processing: A.  The port does not happen to have port security enabled. \n",

      "DNS defines protocols, as well as standards for the text names used throughout the world, and a worldwide set of distributed DNS servers.  The domain names that people use every day when web browsing, which look like www.example.com, follow the DNS naming standards.  Also, no single DNS server knows all the names and matching IP addresses, but the information is distributed across many DNS servers.  So, the DNS servers of the world work together, forwarding queries to each other, until the server that knows the answer supplies the desired IP address information.  The Address Resolution Protocol IP routing logic requires that hosts and routers encapsulate IP packets inside data link layer frames.  In fact, Figure 4-11 shows how every router de-encapsulates each IP packet and encapsulates the IP packet inside a new data-link frame.  On Ethernet LANs, whenever a host or router needs to encapsulate an IP packet in a new Ethernet frame, the host or router knows all the important facts to build that header— except for the destination MAC address.  The host knows the IP address of the next device, either another host IP address or the default router IP address.  A router knows the IP route used for forwarding the IP packet, which lists the next router’s IP address.  However, the hosts and routers do not know those neighboring devices’ MAC addresses beforehand.  TCP/IP defines the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as the method by which any host or router on a LAN can dynamically learn the MAC address of another IP host or router on the same LAN.  ARP defines a protocol that includes the ARP Request, which is a message that asks the simple request “if this is your IP address, please reply with your MAC address.” ARP also defines the ARP Reply message, which indeed lists both the original IP address and the matching MAC address.  Figure 4-14 shows an example that uses the same router and host from the bottom part of the earlier Figure 4-11.  The figure shows the ARP Request on the left as a LAN broadcast, so all hosts receive the frame. \n",

      "A topology like Figure 7-8, with redundant links, is good, but we need to prevent the bad effect of those looping frames.  To avoid Layer 2 loops, all switches need to use STP.  STP causes each interface on a switch to settle into either a blocking state or a forwarding state.  Blocking means that the interface cannot forward or receive data frames, while forwarding means that the interface can send and receive data frames.  If a correct subset of the interfaces is blocked, only a single currently active logical path exists between each pair of LANs.  NOTE STP behaves identically for a transparent bridge and a switch.  Therefore, the terms bridge, switch, and bridging device all are used interchangeably when discussing STP.  The Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide book covers the details of how STP prevents loops.  LAN Switching Summary Switches use Layer 2 logic, examining the Ethernet data-link header to choose how to process frames.  In particular, switches make decisions to forward and filter frames, learn MAC addresses, and use STP to avoid loops, as follows: Step 1.  Switches forward frames based on the destination MAC address: A.  If the destination MAC address is a broadcast, multicast, or unknown desti nation unicast (a unicast not listed in the MAC table), the switch floods the frame.  B.  If the destination MAC address is a known unicast address (a unicast address found in the MAC table): i.  If the outgoing interface listed in the MAC address table is different from the interface in which the frame was received, the switch forwards the frame out the outgoing interface.  156  ii.  If the outgoing interface is the same as the interface in which the frame was received, the switch filters the frame, meaning that the switch simply ignores the frame and does not forward it.  Step 2.  Switches use the following logic to learn MAC address table entries: A.  For each received frame, examine the source MAC address and note the interface from which the frame was received.  B. \n",

      "Honestly, I could have put this topic in several chapters.  The main reason it is here is that you have already seen the IP broadcast addresses in action, including the 255.255.255.255 local broadcast as shown in this chapter.  Review of Unicast (Class A, B, and C) IP Addresses Unicast IP addresses are those Class A, B, and C IP addresses assigned to hosts, router interfaces, and other networking devices.  Because most discussions about IP addressing refer to unicast IP addresses, most of us just refer to them as IP addresses, and leave out the word unicast.  Just to be complete and define the concept, unicast addresses identify one interface on one device to IP.  Just like your postal address gives the post office an address to use to send letters to your one specific house or apartment, a unicast IP address gives the IP network an address to use to send packets to one specific host.  However, with IP, instead of addressing the device, unicast addresses identify individual interfaces.  For example: ■ A router with four LAN interfaces, and two WAN interfaces, have six unicast addresses, each in a different subnet, one for each interface.  ■ A PC with both an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) and a wireless NIC would have two unicast IPv4 addresses, one for each interface .  IP Broadcast Addresses Broadcast IPv4 addresses give IP a way to send one packet that the network delivers to multiple hosts.  IPv4 defines several types of broadcast addresses, with each type being used to reach a different set of hosts.  These different broadcast IP addresses give different overhead protocols like DHCP the ability to efficiently reach all hosts in a specific part of the network.  The following list reviews the three IP broadcast address types: Local broadcast address : 255.255.255.255.  Used to send a packet on a local subnet, knowing that routers will not forward the packet as is.  Also called a limited broadcast. \n",

      "The switch compares the destination MAC address (0200.2222.2222) to the MAC address table, matching the bold table entry.  That matched table entry tells the switch to forward the frame out port F0/2, and only port F0/2.  NOTE A switch’s MAC address table is also called the switching table, or bridging table, or even the Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) table, in reference to the type of physical memory used to store the table.  A switch’s MAC address table lists the location of each MAC relative to that one switch.  In LANs with multiple switches, each switch makes an independent forwarding decision based on its own MAC address table.  Together, they forward the frame so that it eventually arrives at the destination.  For example, Figure 7-4 shows the first switching decision in a case in which Fred sends a frame to Wilma, with destination MAC 0200.3333.3333.  The topology has changed versus the previous figure, this time with two switches, and Fred and Wilma connected to two different switches.  Figure 7-3 shows the first switch’s logic, in reaction to Fred sending the original frame.  Basically, the switch receives the frame in port F0/1, finds the destination MAC (0200.3333.3333) in the MAC address table, sees the outgoing port of G0/1, so SW1 forwards the frame out its G0/1 port . \n",

      "For example, in Figure 9-4, PC1 sends a frame, with PC1’s MAC address as the source address.  SW1’s F0/1 interface can be configured with port security, and if so, SW1 would examine PC1’s MAC address and decide whether PC1 was allowed to send frames into port F0/1.  F0/1 G0/1 G0/2 F0/2 Source = PC1 MAC 1 2 SW1Frame Source = PC2 MAC Frame SW2 Figure 9-4 Source MAC Addresses in Frames as They Enter a Switch Port security also has no restrictions on whether the frame came from a local device or was forwarded through other switches.  For example, switch SW1 could use port security on its G0/1 interface, checking the source MAC address of the frame from PC2, when forwarded up to SW1 from SW2.  Port security has several flexible options, but all operate with the same core concepts.  First, switches enable port security per port, with different settings available per port.  Each port has a maximum number of allowed MAC addresses, meaning that for all frames entering that port, only that number of different source MAC addresses can be used in different incoming frames before port security thinks a violation has occurred.  When a frame with a new source MAC address arrives, pushing the number of MAC addresses past the allowed   203 9 maximum, a port security violation occurs.  At that point, the switch takes action—by default, discarding all future incoming traffic on that port.  The following list summarizes these ideas common to all variations of port security: ■ Define a maximum number of source MAC addresses allowed for all frames coming in the interface.  ■ Watch all incoming frames, and keep a list of all source MAC addresses, plus a counter of the number of different source MAC addresses.  ■ When adding a new source MAC address to the list, if the number of MAC addresses pushes past the configured maximum, a port security violation has occurred.  The switch takes action (the default action is to shut down the interface).  Those rules define the basics, but port security allows other options as well, including letting you configure the specific MAC addresses allowed to send frames in an interface. \n",

And to achieve that goal, switches use logic—logic based on the source and destination MAC address in each frame’s Ethernet header.  LAN switches receive Ethernet frames and then make a switching decision: either forward the frame out some other ports or ignore the frame.  To accomplish this primary mission, switches perform three actions: 1.  Deciding when to forward a frame or when to filter (not forward) a frame, based on the destination MAC address 2.  Preparing to forward frames by learning MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of each frame received by the switch 3.  Preparing to forward only one copy of the frame to the destination by creating a (Layer 2) loop-free environment with other switches by using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) The first action is the switch’s primary job, whereas the other two items are overhead functions.  NOTE Throughout this book’s discussion of LAN switches, the terms switch port and switch interface are synonymous.  Although Chapter 2’s section titled “Ethernet Data-Link Protocols” already discussed the frame format, this discussion of Ethernet switching is pretty important, so reviewing the Ethernet frame at this point might be helpful.  Figure 7-2 shows one popular format for an Ethernet frame.  Basically, a switch would take the frame shown in the figure, make a decision of where to forward the frame, and send the frame out that other interface. \n",

The debug EXEC command gives the network engineer a way to ask IOS to monitor for certain internal events, with that monitoring process continuing over time, so that IOS can issue log messages when those events occur.  The engineer can log in, issue the debug command, and move on to other work.  The user can even log out of the device, and the debug remains enabled.  IOS continues to monitor the request in that debug command and generate log messages about any related events.  The debug remains active until some user issues the no debug command with the same parameters, disabling the debug.  NOTE While the debug command is just one command, it has a huge number of options, much like the show command may be one command, but it also has many, many options.  The best way to see how the debug command works, and how it uses log messages, is to see an example.  Figure 33-4 shows a small network with two routers, both of which happen to use RIPv2.  RIPv2 sends periodic updates every 30 seconds.  In the design shown in Figure 33-4, focus on R2’s advertisement to R1, in which R2 will advertise its route for 172.16.3.0/24 to R1.

      "The idea is that if the switch needs to tell the network administrator some important and possibly urgent information, the administrator might be at the console and might notice the message.  Unfortunately, IOS (by default) displays these syslog messages on the console’s screen at any time—including right in the middle of a command you are entering, or in the middle of the output of a show command.  Having a bunch of text show up unexpectedly can be a bit annoying.  185 8 You could simply disable the feature that sends these messages to the console, and then re-enable the feature later, using the no logging console and logging console global commands.  For example, when working from the console, if you want to temporarily not be bothered by log messages, you can disable the display of these messages with the no logging console global configuration command, and then when finished, enable them again.  However, IOS supplies a reasonable compromise, telling the switch to display syslog messages only at more convenient times, such as at the end of output from a show command.  To do so, just configure the logging synchronous console line subcommand, which basically tells IOS to synchronize the syslog message display with the messages requested using show commands.  Another way to improve the user experience at the console is to control timeouts of the login session from the console or when using Telnet or SSH.  By default, the switch automatically disconnects console and vty (Telnet and SSH) users after 5 minutes of inactivity.  The exec-timeout minutes seconds line subcommand enables you to set the length of that inactivity timer.  In lab (but not in production), you might want to use the special value of 0 minutes and 0 seconds meaning “never time out.” Finally, IOS has an interesting combination of features that can make you wait for a minute or so when you mistype a command.  First, IOS tries to use DNS name resolution on IP hostnames—a generally useful feature.  If you mistype a command, however, IOS thinks you want to Telnet to a host by that name. \n",

      "To make SCP work on a router, the router first needs configuration to support SSH login as normal, as discussed in detail back in Chapter 8, “Configuring Basic Switch Management.” Then you just need to change one command plus add another, as follows: ■ Give the SSH user direct access to privileged mode by adding parameters to the username command, for example, username fred privilege-level 15 password barney.  ■ Enable the SCP server with the ip scp server enable global command.  NOTE While this book does not go into details about IOS privilege levels, enable mode is considered to be privilege level 15.  The username privilege 15 command means that the user would be granted enable mode access at login, without first being placed into user mode.  Then to use SCP to transfer files, the network engineer must use an SCP client on some computer that has network connectivity to the router.  You can search the web for SCP clients, many of which are integrated as part of SSH clients.  However, for the purpose of transferring files with Cisco devices, a command-line SCP client may actually be the best choice.  Example 35-6 shows an SCP file copy with a router, using the Mac OS X built-in scp command.  The command again copies an IOS file from the computer to the router, like the earlier examples.  Note that it uses the full URI of the destination, with the username (wendell), router IP address (192.168.1.9), and IOS filename.

      "For example, some of the switches have 48 RJ-45 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) 10/100/1000 ports, meaning that these ports can autonegotiate the use of 10BASE-T (10 Mbps), 100BASE-T (100 Mbps), or 1000BASE-T (1 Gbps) Ethernet.  Figure 6-1 Cisco 2960-X Catalyst Switch Series Cisco refers to a switch’s physical connectors as either interfaces or ports, with an interface type and interface number.  The interface type, as used in commands on the switch, is either Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and so on for faster speeds.  For Ethernet interfaces that support running at multiple speeds, the permanent name for the interface refers to the fastest supported speed.  For example, a 10/100/1000 interface (that is, an interface that runs at 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1000 Mbps) would be called Gigabit Ethernet no matter what speed is currently in use.  To uniquely number each different interface, some Catalyst switches use a two-digit interface number (x/y), while others have a three-digit number (x/y/z).  For instance, two 10/100/1000 ports on many older Cisco Catalyst switches would be called Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 and Gigabit Ethernet 0/1, while on the newer 2960-X series, two interfaces would be Gigabit Ethernet 1/0/1 and Gigabit Ethernet 1/0/2, for example.  Accessing the Cisco IOS CLI Like any other piece of computer hardware, Cisco switches need some kind of operating system software.  Cisco calls this OS the Internetwork Operating System (IOS).  Cisco IOS Software for Catalyst switches implements and controls logic and functions performed by a Cisco switch.  Besides controlling the switch’s performance and behavior, Cisco IOS also defines an interface for humans called the CLI.  The Cisco IOS CLI allows the user to use a terminal emulation program, which accepts text entered by the user. \n",

      "Autonegotiation For any 10/100 or 10/100/1000 interfaces—that is, interfaces that can run at different speeds—Cisco Catalyst switches default to a setting of duplex auto and speed auto.  As a result, those interfaces attempt to automatically determine the speed and duplex setting to use.  Alternatively, you can configure most devices, switch interfaces included, to use a specific speed and/or duplex.  In practice, using autonegotiation is easy: just leave the speed and duplex at the default setting, and let the switch port negotiate what settings to use on each port.  However, problems can occur due to unfortunate combinations of configuration.  Therefore, this next topic walks through more detail about the concepts behind autonegotiation, so you know better how to interpret the meaning of the switch show commands and when to choose to use a particular configuration setting.  Autonegotiation Under Working Conditions Ethernet devices on the ends of a link must use the same standard or they cannot correctly send data.  For example, a NIC cannot use 100BASE-T, which uses a two-pair UTP cable with a 100-Mbps speed, while the switch port on the other end of the link uses 1000BASE-T.  Even if you used a cable that works with Gigabit Ethernet, the link would not work with one end trying to send at 100 Mbps while the other tried to receive the data at 1000 Mbps.  199 9 Upgrading to new and faster Ethernet standards becomes a problem because both ends have to use the same standard.  For example, if you replace an old PC with a new one, the old one might have been using 100BASE-T while the new one uses 1000BASE-T.  The switch port on the other end of the link needs to now use 1000BASE-T, so you upgrade the switch.  If that switch had ports that would use only 1000BASE-T, you would need to upgrade all the other PCs connected to the switch.  So, having both PC network interface cards (NIC) and switch ports that support multiple standards/speeds makes it much easier to migrate to the next better standard. \n",

      "For instance, if you have good reason to configure the speed and duplex on a port, maybe add a description that says why you did.  Example 9-1 shows how to configure duplex and speed, as well as the description command, which is simply a text description that can be configured by the administrator.  Example 9-1 Configuring speed, duplex, and description on Switch Emma Emma# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.

The various interface commands move the user from global mode into interface configuration mode for a specific interface.  For instance, the example configures the duplex, speed, and description commands all just after the interface FastEthernet 0/1 command, which means that all three of those configuration settings apply to interface Fa0/1, and not to the other interfaces.  The show interfaces status command lists much of the detail configured in Example 9-1, even with only one line of output per interface.  Example 9-2 shows an example, just after the configuration in Example 9-1 was added to the switch.  It also lists the configured speed of 100 and duplex full per the speed and duplex commands in Example 9-1.

      "FastEthernet 0/2 (Fa0/2): Example 9-1 did not configure this port at all.  This port had all default configuration.  Note that the “auto” text under the speed and duplex heading means that this port will attempt to autonegotiate both settings when the port comes up.  However, this port also does not have a cable connected (again on purpose, for comparison).  FastEthernet 0/4 (Fa0/4): Like Fa0/2, this port has all default configuration, but was cabled to another working device to give yet another contrasting example.  This device completed the autonegotiation process, so instead of “auto” under the speed and duplex headings, the output lists the negotiated speed and duplex (a-full and a-100).  Note that the text includes the ato mean that the listed speed and duplex values were autonegotiated.  195 9 Configuring Multiple Interfaces with the interface range Command The bottom of the configuration in Example 9-1 shows a way to shorten your configuration work when making the same setting on multiple consecutive interfaces.  To do so, use the interface range command.  In the example, the interface range FastEthernet 0/11 20 command tells IOS that the next subcommand(s) apply to interfaces Fa0/11 through Fa0/20.  You can define a range as long as all interfaces are the same type and are numbered consecutively.  NOTE This book spells out all parameters fully to avoid confusion.  However, most everyone abbreviates what they type in the CLI to the shortest unique abbreviation.  For instance, the configuration commands int f0/1 and int ran f0/11 20 would also be acceptable.  IOS does not actually put the interface range command into the configuration.  Instead, it acts as if you had typed the subcommand under every single interface in the specified range.  Example 9-3 shows an excerpt from the show running-config command, listing the configuration of interfaces F0/11–12 from the configuration in Example 9-1. \n",

      "For example, in Figure 9-4, switch SW1 connects through interface F0/1 to PC1, so the port security configuration could list PC1’s MAC address as the specific allowed MAC address.  But predefining MAC addresses for port security is optional: You can predefine all MAC addresses, none, or a subset of the MAC addresses.  You might like the idea of predefining the MAC addresses for port security, but finding the MAC address of each device can be a bother.  Port security provides an easy way to discover the MAC addresses used off each port using a feature called sticky secure MAC addresses.  With this feature, port security learns the MAC addresses off each port and stores them in the port security configuration (in the running-config file).  This feature helps reduce the big effort of finding out the MAC address of each device.  As you can see, port security has a lot of detailed options.  The next few sections walk you through these options to pull the ideas together.  Configuring Port Security Port security configuration involves several steps.  First, you need to disable the negotiation of a feature that is not discussed until Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” whether the port is an access or trunk port.  For now, accept that port security requires a port to be configured to either be an access port or a trunking port.  The rest of the commands enable port security, set the maximum allowed MAC addresses per port, and configure the actual MAC addresses, as detailed in this list: Step 1.  Make the switch interface either a static access or trunk interface using the switchport mode access or the switchport mode trunk interface subcommands, respectively.  Step 2.  Enable port security using the switchport port-security interface subcommand.  Step 3.

      "As covered in the ICND1 book’s Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” the port security feature can be used to cause the switch to discard some frames sent into and out of an interface.  Port security has three basic features with which it determines which frames to filter: ■ Limit which specific MAC addresses can send and receive frames on a switch interface, discarding frames to/from other MAC addresses ■ Limit the number of MAC addresses using the interface, discarding frames to/from MAC addresses learned after the maximum limit is reached ■ A combination of the previous two points The first port security troubleshooting step should be to find which interfaces have port security enabled, followed by a determination as to whether any violations are currently occurring.  The trickiest part relates to the differences in what the IOS does in reaction to violations based on the switchport port-security violation violation-mode interface subcommand, which tells the switch what to do when a violation occurs.  The general process to find port security issues is as follows: Step 1.  Identify all interfaces on which port security is enabled (show running-config or show port-security).  Step 2.  Determine whether a security violation is currently occurring based in part on the violation mode of the interface’s port security configuration, as follows: A. shutdown: The interface will be in an err-disabled state, and the port secu rity port status will be secure-down.  288  B. restrict: The interface will be in a connected state, the port security port status will be secure-up, but the show port-security interface command will show an incrementing violations counter.  C. protect: The interface will be in a connected state, and the show port-security interface command will not show an incrementing violations counter.  Step 3.  In all cases, compare the port security configuration to the diagram and to the Last Source Address field in the output of the show port-security interface command.  Because IOS reacts so differently with shutdown mode as compared to restrict and protect modes, the next few pages explain the differences—first for shutdown mode, then for the other two modes. \n",

These modes still discard offending traffic, but the interface remains in a connected (up/ up) state, and in a port security state of secure-up.  As a result, the port continues to forward good traffic and discard offending traffic.  290  Having a port in a seemingly good state that also discards traffic can be a challenge when troubleshooting.  Basically, you have to know about this possible pitfall, and then know how to tell when port security is discarding some traffic on a port even though the interface status looks good.

      "Whenever a port that could use full duplex (therefore avoiding collisions) happens to use half duplex—by incorrect configuration, by the result of autonegotiation, or any other reason—collisions can now occur.  In those cases, engineers need to be able identify the collision domain.  Summarizing the key points about collision domains: ■ LAN switches place each separate interface into a separate collision domain.  ■ LAN bridges, which use the same logic as switches, placed each interface into a separate collision domain.  ■ Routers place each LAN interface into a separate collision domain.  (The term collision domain does not apply to WAN interfaces.)  ■ LAN hubs do not place each interface into a separate collision domain.  224  ■ A modern LAN, with all LAN switches and routers, with full duplex on each link, would not have collisions at all.  ■ In a modern LAN with all switches and routers, even though full duplex removes collisions, think of each Ethernet link as a separate collision domain when the need to troubleshoot arises.  Figure 10-5 shows an example with a design that includes hubs, bridges, switches, and routers—a design that you would not use today, but it makes a good backdrop to remind us about which devices create separate collision domains.

To begin, think about a modern LAN for a moment, and where a broadcast frame flows.  Imagine that all the switches still used the switch default to put each interface into VLAN 1.  As a result, a broadcast sent by any one device would be flooded to all devices connected to all switches (except for the device that sent the original frame).  For instance, in Figure 10-6, under the assumption that all ports are still assigned to VLAN 1, a broadcast would flow to all the devices shown in the figure. \n",

NOTE A switch’s MAC address table is also called the switching table, or bridging table, or even the Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) table, in reference to the type of physical memory used to store the table.  A switch’s MAC address table lists the location of each MAC relative to that one switch.  In LANs with multiple switches, each switch makes an independent forwarding decision based on its own MAC address table.  Together, they forward the frame so that it eventually arrives at the destination.  For example, Figure 7-4 shows the first switching decision in a case in which Fred sends a frame to Wilma, with destination MAC 0200.3333.3333.  The topology has changed versus the previous figure, this time with two switches, and Fred and Wilma connected to two different switches.  Figure 7-3 shows the first switch’s logic, in reaction to Fred sending the original frame.  Basically, the switch receives the frame in port F0/1, finds the destination MAC (0200.3333.3333) in the MAC address table, sees the outgoing port of G0/1, so SW1 forwards the frame out its G0/1 port . \n",

Figure 22-4 VLSM Design with Possible Overlap Now imagine that the exam question shows you the figure, and either directly or indirectly asks whether overlapping subnets exist.  This type of question might simply tell you that some hosts cannot ping each other, or it might not even mention that the root cause could be that some of the subnets overlap.  To answer such a question, you could follow this simple but possibly laborious process: Step 1.  Calculate the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address of each subnet, which gives you the range of addresses in that subnet.  Step 2.  List the subnet IDs in numerical order (along with their subnet broadcast addresses).  Step 3.  Scan the list from top to bottom, comparing each pair of adjacent entries, to see whether their range of addresses overlaps.  For example, Table 22-3 completes the first two steps based on Figure 22-4, listing the subnet IDs and subnet broadcast addresses, in numerical order based on the subnet IDs. \n",

This route is for 172.30.22.0/24, as learned from R2.  It lists R1’s local G0/2 interface as the outgoing interface because R1 received the update on R1’s G0/2 interface.  R1’s route also lists R2’s IP address of 172.30.1.2 as next-hop router because that’s the IP address from which R1 learned the route.  Think of R1’s outgoing interface and next-hop router information as the forwarding instructions for this route.  Split Horizon Figure 19-4 also shows a common DV feature called split horizon.  Note that both routers list all four subnets in their IP routing tables.  However, the RIP update messages do not list four subnets.  The reason?  Split horizon.  Split horizon is a DV feature that tells a router to omit some routes from an update sent out an interface.  Which routes are omitted from an update sent out interface X?  The routes that would use interface X as the outgoing interface.  Those routes that are not advertised on an interface usually include the routes learned in routing updates received on that interface.  Split horizon is difficult to learn by reading words, and much easier to learn by seeing an example.  Figure 19-5 continues the same example as Figure 19-4, but focusing on R1’s RIP update sent out R1’s G0/2 interface to R2.  Figure 19-5 shows R1’s routing table with three light-colored routes, all of which list G0/2 as the outgoing interface.  When building the RIP update to send out that same G0/2 interface, split horizon rules tell R1 to ignore those lightcolored routes. \n",

      "Subnet broadcast address : One reserved address for each subnet, namely the numerically highest number in the subnet, as discussed in Chapter 15, “Analyzing Subnet Masks.” A packet sent to a subnet broadcast address can be routed to the router connected to that subnet, and then sent as a data link broadcast to all hosts in that one subnet.  Also called an all-hosts broadcast to emphasize that all hosts in a subnet are reached, and also called a directed broadcast.  Network broadcast address : One reserved address for each classful network, namely the numerically highest number in the network.  Used to send one packet to all hosts in that one network.  Also called an all-subnets broadcast, referring to the fact that the packet reaches all subnets in a network .  This chapter has already shown how a local broadcast works, sending the message over the same subnet in which it was first transmitted, but no further.  However, the other two types are a little more interesting.  Subnet and network broadcasts provide a way to send packets to all hosts in a subnet or network (respectively) while reducing waste.  For instance, with a subnet broadcast, routers forward the packet just like any other IP packet going to that subnet.  When that packet  492  arrives at the router connected to that subnet, the last router then encapsulates the packet in a LAN broadcast, so that all hosts receive a copy.

      "Summarizing the main points about broadcast domains: ■ Broadcasts exists, so be ready to analyze a design to define each broadcast domain, that is, each set of devices whose broadcasts reach the other devices in that domain.  ■ VLANs by definition are broadcast domains created though configuration.  ■ Routers, because they do not forward LAN broadcasts, create separate broadcast domains off their separate Ethernet interfaces.  Analyzing Campus LAN Topologies The term campus LAN refers to the LAN created to support the devices in a building or in multiple buildings in somewhat close proximity to one another.  For example, a company might lease office space in several buildings in the same office park.  The network engineers can then build a campus LAN that includes switches in each building, plus Ethernet links between the switches in the buildings, to create a larger campus LAN.  When planning and designing a campus LAN, the engineers must consider the types of Ethernet available and the cabling lengths supported by each type.  The engineers also need to choose the speeds required for each Ethernet segment.  In addition, some thought needs to be given to the idea that some switches should be used to connect directly to end-user devices, whereas other switches might need to simply connect to a large number of these end-user switches.  Finally, most projects require that the engineer consider the type of equipment that is already installed and whether an increase in speed on some segments is worth the cost of buying new equipment.  This second of three major sections of the chapter discusses the topology of a campus LAN design.

Full mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between each pair of nodes.  Partial mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between some pairs of nodes, but not all.  In other words, a mesh that is not a full mesh.  Hybrid: A design that combines topology design concepts into a larger (typically more complex) design.  Armed with those formal definitions, note that the two-tier design is indeed a hybrid design that uses both a star topology at the access layer and a partial mesh at the distribution layer.  To see why, consider Figure 10-11.  It redraws a typical access layer switch, but instead of putting the PCs all below the switch, it spreads them around the switch.  Then on the right, a similar version of the same drawing shows why the term star might be used—the topology looks a little like a child’s drawing of a star.  Figure 10-11 The Star Topology Design Concept in Networking The distribution layer creates a partial mesh.  If you view the access and distribution switches as nodes in a design, some nodes have a link between them, and some do not.  Just refer to Figure 10-10 and note that, by design, none of the access layer switches connect to each other.  Finally, a design could use a full mesh.  However, for a variety of reasons beyond the scope of the design discussion here, a campus design typically does not need to use the number of links and ports required by a full mesh design. \n",

Now think about a full mesh at the distribution layer for a design like Figure 10-10, with 40 access switches and two distribution switches.

      "On the exam, you should focus on isolating the root cause of the problem, after which you will either (a) fix the problem or (b) answer a multichoice question about the symptoms and the root cause of the problem.  The exam uses two question types as the primary means to test troubleshooting skills.  Sim questions begin with a broken configuration; your job is to find the configuration problem, and answer the question by fixing or completing the configuration.  These are straightforward configuration troubleshooting questions, and you can recognize them on the exam when the exam tells you to answer the question by changing the configuration.  Simlet questions also give you a simulator where you access the command-line interface (CLI).  However, instead of changing the configuration, these questions require you to verify the current operation of the network and then answer multichoice questions about the current operation.  These questions make you do the same kinds of commands you would use when doing problem isolation and documentation, and then assess what you found by asking you several multichoice questions.  At some point, whether you stop now or sometime when you have 10 to 15 spare minutes, take the time to search Cisco.com for “exam tutorial.” Cisco’s exam tutorial shows all the question types, including Sim and Simlet types, and you can take over the user interface to get a better sense for how to navigate in the same user interface you will see on exam day.  A Deeper Look at Problem Isolation On the exam, you may do 5–10 show commands in a Simlet question before finding all the answers to all the multichoice questions within that one Simlet question.  So it sometimes helps to go through problem isolation like what you would do in a real network.  In some questions, it may be obvious that the problem will be something to do with the switches or VLANs, but in others, you may have to do extra problem isolation work to even determine whether the problem is a WAN or LAN or routing problem, and which part of the network has the problem.  For example, consider the following problem based on the network in Figure 12-1.  PC1 and PC2 supposedly sit in the same VLAN (10). \n",

The first option is pretty obvious, but the second one is less obvious.  Figure 5 shows a study plan in which you complete the Ethernet parts in the ICND1, then the Ethernet part in ICND2.

      "■ Distribution: Provides an aggregation point for access switches, providing connectivity to the rest of the devices in the LAN, forwarding frames between switches, but not connecting directly to end-user devices.  ■ Core: Aggregates distribution switches in very large campus LANs, providing very high forwarding rates for the larger volume of traffic due to the size of the network.  Topology Design Terminology The ICND1 and CCNA exam topics specifically mention several network design terms related to topology.  This next topic summarizes those key terms to connect the terms to the matching ideas.  233 10 First, consider Figure 10-15, which shows a few of the terms.  First, on the left, drawings often show access switches with a series of cables, parallel to each other.  However, an access switch and its access links is often called a star topology.  Why?  Look at the redrawn access switch in the center of the figure, with the cables radiating out from the center.  It does not look like a real star, but it looks a little like a child’s drawing of a star, hence the term star topology.  Access Switch Access Switch: Star A1 A2 D1 D2 Uplinks: Partial Mesh SW1 SW1 Figure 10-15 LAN Design Terminology The right side of the figure repeats a typical two-tier design, focusing on the mesh of links between the access and distribution switches.  Any group of nodes that connect with more links than a star topology is typically called a mesh.  In this case, the mesh is a partial mesh, because not all nodes have a direct link between each other.  A design that connects all nodes with a link would be a full mesh.  Real networks make use of these topology ideas, but often a network combines the ideas together.  For instance, the right side of Figure 10-14 combines the star topology of the access layer with the partial mesh of the distribution layer.  So you might hear these designs that combine concepts called a hybrid design.  Analyzing LAN Physical Standard Choices When you look at the design of a network designed by someone else, you can look at all the different types of cabling used, the different types of switch ports, and the Ethernet standards used in each case. \n",

When the IEEE introduces support for a new type of cabling, or a faster speed, they create a new standard as part of 802.3.  These new standards have a few letters behind the name.  So, when speaking of the standards, sometimes you might refer to the standard name (with letters).  For instance, the IEEE standardized Gigabit Ethernet support using inexpensive UTP cabling in standard 802.3ab.

      "Fiber-optic cabling, the more expensive alternative, allows Ethernet nodes to send light over glass fibers in the center of the cable.  Although more expensive, optical cables typically allow longer cabling distances between nodes.  To be ready to choose the products to purchase for a new Ethernet LAN, a network engineer must know the names and features of the different Ethernet standards supported in Ethernet products.  The IEEE defines Ethernet physical layer standards using a couple of naming conventions.  The formal name begins with 802.3 followed by some suffix letters.  The IEEE also uses more meaningful shortcut names that identify the speed, as well as a clue about whether the cabling is UTP (with a suffix that includes T) or fiber (with a suffix that includes X).  Table 2-2 lists a few Ethernet physical layer standards.  First, the table lists enough names so that you get a sense of the IEEE naming conventions.  It also lists the four most common standards that use UTP cabling, because this book’s discussion of Ethernet focuses mainly on the UTP options.

Consistent Behavior over All Links Using the Ethernet Data Link Layer Although Ethernet includes many physical layer standards, Ethernet acts like a single LAN technology because it uses the same data link layer standard over all types of Ethernet physical links.  That standard defines a common Ethernet header and trailer. \n",

But thinking about the topology does not tell you which specific standards to follow for each link.  Ultimately, you need to pick which Ethernet standard to use for each link, based on the following kinds of facts about each physical standard: ■ The speed ■ The maximum distance allowed between devices when using that standard/cabling ■ The cost of the cabling and switch hardware ■ The availability of that type of cabling already installed at your facilities Consider the three most common types of Ethernet today (10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, and 1000BASE-T).  They all have the same 100-meter UTP cable length restriction.  They all use UTP cabling.  However, not all UTP cabling meets the same quality standard, and as it turns out, the faster the Ethernet standard, the higher the required cable quality category needed to support that standard.  As a result, some buildings might have better cabling that supports speeds up through Gigabit Ethernet, whereas some buildings may support only Fast Ethernet.  The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA; tiaonline.org) defines Ethernet cabling quality standards. \n",

      "The term prefix refers to the same idea as subnet; it just uses terminology from the classless addressing way to describe IP addresses, as discussed in Chapter 15’s section “Classless and Classful Addressing.” The biggest terminology confusion arises between the terms network and subnet.  In the real world, people often use these terms synonymously, and that is perfectly reasonable in some cases.  In other cases, the specific meaning of these terms, and their differences, matter to what is being discussed.  For example, people often might say, “What is the network ID?” when they really want to know the subnet ID.  In another case, they might want to know the Class A, B, or C network ID.  So, when one engineer asks something like, “What’s the net ID for 172.16.150.41 slash 18?” use the context to figure out whether he wants the literal classful network ID (172.16.0.0, in this case) or the literal subnet ID (172.16.128.0, in this case).  For the exams, be ready to notice when the terms subnet and network are used, and then use the context to figure out the specific meaning of the term in that case.  Table 16-2 summarizes the key facts about the subnet ID, along with the possible synonyms, for easier review and study.  361 16 Table 16-2 Summary of Subnet ID Key Facts Definition Number that represents the subnet Numeric Value First (smallest) number in the subnet Literal Synonyms Subnet number, subnet address, prefix, resident subnet Common-Use Synonyms Network, network ID, network number, network address Typically Seen In...

The original purpose for the subnet broadcast address was to give hosts a way to send one packet to all hosts in a subnet, and to do so efficiently. \n",

      "Following the same design logic, devices in different VLANs need to be in different subnets.  For example, in Figure 11-7, the two PCs on the left sit in VLAN 10, in subnet 10.  The two PCs on the right sit in a different VLAN (20), with a different subnet (20).  Wilma Betty Dino VLAN 20 Subnet 20 VLAN 10 Subnet 10 Fred Figure 11-7 Layer 2 Switch Does Not Route Between the VLANs NOTE The figure refers to subnets somewhat generally, like “subnet 10,” just so the subnet numbers do not distract.  Also, note that the subnet numbers do not have to be the same number as the VLAN numbers.  Figure 11-7 shows the switch as if it were two switches broken in two to emphasize the point that Layer 2 switches will not forward data between two VLANs.  When configured with some ports in VLAN 10 and others in VLAN 20, the switch acts like two separate switches in which it will forward traffic.  In fact, one goal of VLANs is to separate traffic in one VLAN from another, preventing frames in one VLAN from leaking over to other  250  VLANs.  For example, when Dino (in VLAN 10) sends any Ethernet frame, if SW1 is a Layer 2 switch, that switch will not forward the frame to the PCs on the right in VLAN 20.  The network as a whole needs to support traffic flowing into and out of each VLAN, even though the Layer 2 switch does not forward frames outside a VLAN.  The job of forwarding data into and out of a VLAN falls to routers.  Instead of switching Layer 2 Ethernet frames between the two VLANs, the network must route Layer 3 packets between the two subnets.  That previous paragraph has some very specific wording related to Layers 2 and 3, so take a moment to reread and reconsider it for a moment. \n",

The ICND2 book’s chapters about OSPF describe link state logic, and the ICND2 book’s chapters on EIGRP get into more detail about some advanced distance vector features.  The Concept of a Distance and a Vector The term distance vector describes what a router knows about each route.  When a router learns about a route to a subnet, the routers learn three important facts related to each route: the destination subnet, the distance (that is, the routing protocol metric), and the vector (that is, the link and next-hop router to use as part of that route).  Figure 19-3 begins to develop that concept showing RIP updates in the small boxes on the left.  That is, Router R1 receives RIP updates from three neighboring routers.  Each update describes a different route for subnet X, with a different metric.  The fact that a particular router sends the RIP message identifies the next-hop router for the route. \n",

The output does list all other interfaces (those not currently trunking), no matter whether the interface is in a working or nonworking state.  If the show vlan and show interface switchport commands are not available in a particular exam question, the show mac address-table command can also help identify the access VLAN.  This command lists the MAC address table, with each entry including a MAC address, interface, and VLAN ID.  If the exam question implies that a switch interface connects to a single device PC, you should only see one MAC table entry that lists that particular access interface; the VLAN ID listed for that same entry identifies the access VLAN.  (You cannot make such assumptions for trunking interfaces.)  After you determine the access interfaces and associated VLANs, if the interface is assigned to the wrong VLAN, use the switchport access vlan vlan-id interface subcommand to assign the correct VLAN ID.  Access VLANs Not Being Defined Switches do not forward frames for VLANs that are (a) not configured or (b) configured but disabled (shut down).

      "Analyzing VLANs and VLAN Trunks A switch’s forwarding process, as discussed earlier in the section “Analyzing the Forwarding Path,” depends in part on VLANs and VLAN trunking.  Before a switch can forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must know about a VLAN and the VLAN must be active.  And before a switch can forward a frame over a VLAN trunk, the trunk must currently allow that VLAN to pass over the trunk.  This final of the five major sections in this chapter focuses on VLAN and VLAN trunking issues, specifically issues that impact the frame switching process.  The four potential issues are as follows: Step 1.  Identify all access interfaces and their assigned access VLANs and reassign into the correct VLANs as needed.  Step 2.  Determine whether the VLANs both exist (configured or learned with VTP) and are active on each switch.  If not, configure and activate the VLANs to resolve problems as needed.  Step 3.  Check the allowed VLAN lists, on the switches on both ends of the trunk, and ensure that the lists of allowed VLANs are the same.  Step 4.  Check for incorrect configuration settings that result in one switch operating as a trunk, with the neighboring switch not operating as a trunk.  Ensuring That the Right Access Interfaces Are in the Right VLANs To ensure that each access interface has been assigned to the correct VLAN, engineers simply need to determine which switch interfaces are access interfaces instead of trunk interfaces, determine the assigned access VLANs on each interface, and compare the information to the documentation.  The show commands listed in Table 12-3 can be particularly helpful in this process. \n",

      "DTP can also negotiate whether the two devices on the link agree to trunk at all, as guided by the local switch port’s administrative mode.  The administrative mode refers to the configuration setting for whether trunking should be used.  Each interface also has an operational mode, which refers to what is currently happening on the interface, and might have been chosen by DTP’s negotiation with the other device.  Cisco switches use the switchport mode interface subcommand to define the administrative trunking mode, as listed in Table 11-2.  Table 11-2 Trunking Administrative Mode Options with the switchport mode Command Command Option Description access Always act as an access (nontrunk) port trunk Always act as a trunk port dynamic desirable Initiates negotiation messages and responds to negotiation messages to dynamically choose whether to start using trunking dynamic auto Passively waits to receive trunk negotiation messages, at which point the switch will respond and negotiate whether to use trunking For example, consider the two switches shown in Figure 11-12.  This figure shows an expansion of the network of Figure 11-11, with a trunk to a new switch (SW2) and with parts of VLANs 1 and 3 on ports attached to SW2.  The two switches use a Gigabit Ethernet link for the trunk.  In this case, the trunk does not dynamically form by default, because both (2960) switches default to an administrative mode of dynamic auto, meaning that neither switch initiates the trunk negotiation process.  By changing one switch to use dynamic desirable mode, which does initiate the negotiation, the switches negotiate to use trunking, specifically 802.1Q because the 2960s support only 802.1Q.  259 11 Fa0/15 Fa0/16 VLAN 3 Fa0/12 Fa0/11 VLAN 1 VLAN 2 Fa0/13 Fa0/14 SW1 Fa0/23 Fa0/24 Fa0/22 Fa0/21 SW2 Gi0/1 Trunk Gi0/2 Figure 11-12 Network with Two Switches and Three VLANs Example 11-3 begins by showing the two switches in Figure 11-12 with the default configuration so that the two switches do not trunk. \n",

      "How do you do that in the presence of an IP addressing and subnetting plan, requiring you to apply all that subnetting math from Part IV of this book and from the last few chapters?  This chapter and the next start to answer some of those questions.  In particular, this chapter focuses on IP troubleshooting tools, with two in particular: ping and traceroute.  Both tools test the IPv4 data plane; that is, the ability of each networking device to route or forward IPv4 packets.  A problem with routing is often a symptom but not a root cause, with the root cause then being other problems, like interface failures, routing protocol issues, misconfiguration of various features, and the like.  The chapter ends with a short discussion of two other router tools that can also be useful for troubleshooting: Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH).  “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz The troubleshooting chapters of this book pull in concepts from many other chapters.  In fact, troubleshooting IPv4 may be one of the most important topics to learn for both the CCENT and CCNA R&S certifications.  So, it is useful to read this chapter (and the next chapter, also about troubleshooting IPv4 networks) regardless of your current knowledge level.  For these reasons, some troubleshooting chapters do not include a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz.  Foundation Topics Problem Isolation Using the ping Command Someone sends you an email or text, or a phone message, asking you to look into a user’s network problem.  You Secure Shell (SSH) to a router and issue a ping command that works.  What does that result rule out as a possible reason for the problem?  What does it rule in as still being a possible root cause?  Then you issue another ping to another address, and this time the ping fails.  Again, what does the failure of that ping command tell you?  What parts of IPv4 routing may still be a problem, and what parts do you now know are not a problem?  The ping command gives us one of the most common network troubleshooting tools. \n",

      "To help you prepare to answer troubleshooting questions, this book, as well as the ICND2 book, devotes different book elements to troubleshooting.  These book elements do not just list the configuration, and they do not just list example output from different show commands.  Instead, these elements discuss how to use different commands to verify what should be happening, and if not, how to find the root cause of the problem.  This chapter discusses a wide number of topics, many of which have already been discussed in Part II and the preceding chapters in Part III of the ICND1 book.  First, this chapter begins with some perspectives on troubleshooting networking problems, because it is the first book element that focuses on troubleshooting, and because there is one exam topic that mentions the troubleshooting process and methods.  At that point, this chapter looks at four key technical topics that matter to verifying and troubleshooting Ethernet LANs, as follows: ■ Analyzing switch interfaces and cabling ■ Predicting where switches will forward frames ■ Troubleshooting port security ■ Analyzing VLANs and VLAN trunks.  Perspectives on Applying Troubleshooting Methodologies This first section of the chapter takes a brief diversion for one particular big idea: what troubleshooting processes could be used to resolve networking problems?  Most of the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exam topics list the word “troubleshoot” along with some technology, mostly with some feature that you configure on a switch or router.  One exam topic makes mention of the troubleshooting process.  This first section examines the troubleshooting process as an end to itself.  The first important perspective on the troubleshooting process is this: you can troubleshoot using any process or method that you want.  However, all good methods have the same characteristics that result in faster resolution of the problem, and a better chance of avoiding that same problem in the future.  The one exam topic that mentions troubleshooting methods uses some pretty common terminology found in troubleshooting methods both inside IT and in other industries as well.  The ideas make good common sense.  From the exam topics: Step 1. \n",

      "On the exam, you should focus on isolating the root cause of the problem, after which you will either (a) fix the problem or (b) answer a multichoice question about the symptoms and the root cause of the problem.  The exam uses two question types as the primary means to test troubleshooting skills.  Sim questions begin with a broken configuration; your job is to find the configuration problem, and answer the question by fixing or completing the configuration.  These are straightforward configuration troubleshooting questions, and you can recognize them on the exam when the exam tells you to answer the question by changing the configuration.  Simlet questions also give you a simulator where you access the command-line interface (CLI).  However, instead of changing the configuration, these questions require you to verify the current operation of the network and then answer multichoice questions about the current operation.  These questions make you do the same kinds of commands you would use when doing problem isolation and documentation, and then assess what you found by asking you several multichoice questions.  At some point, whether you stop now or sometime when you have 10 to 15 spare minutes, take the time to search Cisco.com for “exam tutorial.” Cisco’s exam tutorial shows all the question types, including Sim and Simlet types, and you can take over the user interface to get a better sense for how to navigate in the same user interface you will see on exam day.  A Deeper Look at Problem Isolation On the exam, you may do 5–10 show commands in a Simlet question before finding all the answers to all the multichoice questions within that one Simlet question.  So it sometimes helps to go through problem isolation like what you would do in a real network.  In some questions, it may be obvious that the problem will be something to do with the switches or VLANs, but in others, you may have to do extra problem isolation work to even determine whether the problem is a WAN or LAN or routing problem, and which part of the network has the problem.  For example, consider the following problem based on the network in Figure 12-1.  PC1 and PC2 supposedly sit in the same VLAN (10). \n",

      "The switch times out (removes) any entries whose timer reaches the defined aging time.  Example 7-7 shows the aging timer setting for the entire switch.  The aging time can be configured to a different time, globally and per-vlan.

The MAC address table uses content-addressable memory (CAM), a physical memory that has great table lookup capabilities.  However, the size of the table depends on the size of the CAM in a particular model of switch.  When a switch tries to add a new table entry, and finds the table full, the switch times out (removes) the oldest table entry to make space.  For perspective, the end of Example 7-7 lists the size of a Cisco Catalyst switch’s MAC table at about 8000 entries—the same four existing entries from the earlier examples, with space for 7299 more.  162  Finally, you can remove the dynamic entries from the MAC address table with the clear mac address-table dynamic command.  Note that the show commands in this chapter can be executed from user and enable mode, but the clear command happens to be a privileged mode command.  MAC Address Tables with Multiple Switches Finally, to complete the discussion, it helps to think about an example with multiple switches, just to emphasize how MAC learning, forwarding, and flooding happens independently on each LAN switch.

      "As covered in the ICND1 book’s Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” the port security feature can be used to cause the switch to discard some frames sent into and out of an interface.  Port security has three basic features with which it determines which frames to filter: ■ Limit which specific MAC addresses can send and receive frames on a switch interface, discarding frames to/from other MAC addresses ■ Limit the number of MAC addresses using the interface, discarding frames to/from MAC addresses learned after the maximum limit is reached ■ A combination of the previous two points The first port security troubleshooting step should be to find which interfaces have port security enabled, followed by a determination as to whether any violations are currently occurring.  The trickiest part relates to the differences in what the IOS does in reaction to violations based on the switchport port-security violation violation-mode interface subcommand, which tells the switch what to do when a violation occurs.  The general process to find port security issues is as follows: Step 1.  Identify all interfaces on which port security is enabled (show running-config or show port-security).  Step 2.  Determine whether a security violation is currently occurring based in part on the violation mode of the interface’s port security configuration, as follows: A. shutdown: The interface will be in an err-disabled state, and the port secu rity port status will be secure-down.  288  B. restrict: The interface will be in a connected state, the port security port status will be secure-up, but the show port-security interface command will show an incrementing violations counter.  C. protect: The interface will be in a connected state, and the show port-security interface command will not show an incrementing violations counter.  Step 3.  In all cases, compare the port security configuration to the diagram and to the Last Source Address field in the output of the show port-security interface command.  Because IOS reacts so differently with shutdown mode as compared to restrict and protect modes, the next few pages explain the differences—first for shutdown mode, then for the other two modes. \n",

      "For example, in Figure 9-4, switch SW1 connects through interface F0/1 to PC1, so the port security configuration could list PC1’s MAC address as the specific allowed MAC address.  But predefining MAC addresses for port security is optional: You can predefine all MAC addresses, none, or a subset of the MAC addresses.  You might like the idea of predefining the MAC addresses for port security, but finding the MAC address of each device can be a bother.  Port security provides an easy way to discover the MAC addresses used off each port using a feature called sticky secure MAC addresses.  With this feature, port security learns the MAC addresses off each port and stores them in the port security configuration (in the running-config file).  This feature helps reduce the big effort of finding out the MAC address of each device.  As you can see, port security has a lot of detailed options.  The next few sections walk you through these options to pull the ideas together.  Configuring Port Security Port security configuration involves several steps.  First, you need to disable the negotiation of a feature that is not discussed until Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” whether the port is an access or trunk port.  For now, accept that port security requires a port to be configured to either be an access port or a trunking port.  The rest of the commands enable port security, set the maximum allowed MAC addresses per port, and configure the actual MAC addresses, as detailed in this list: Step 1.  Make the switch interface either a static access or trunk interface using the switchport mode access or the switchport mode trunk interface subcommands, respectively.  Step 2.  Enable port security using the switchport port-security interface subcommand.  Step 3.  (Optional) Override the default maximum number of allowed MAC addresses associated with the interface (1) by using the switchport port-security maximum number interface subcommand.  Step 4.  (Optional) Override the default action to take upon a security violation (shutdown) using the switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict | shutdown} interface subcommand.

So, the first mask maximizes the number of hosts/subnet.  The last mask uses the minimum value for the number of host bits, therefore using the most number of subnet bits allowed while still meeting the requirements.  As a result, the last mask maximizes the number of subnets allowed.  Finding All the Masks: Math Although the concepts related to the example shown in Figures 21-5 and 21-6 are important, you can find the range of masks that meets the requirements more easily just using some simple math.  The process to find the masks just requires a few steps, after you know N and the minimum values of S and H. The process finds the value of /P when using the least number of subnet bits, and when using the least number of host bits, as follows: Step 1.  Calculate the shortest prefix mask (/P) based on the minimum value of S, where P = N + S. Step 2.  Calculate the longest prefix mask (/P) based on the minimum value of H, where P = 32 – H. Step 3.  The range of valid masks includes all /P values between the two values calculated in the previous steps.  For example, in the example shown in Figure 21-6, N = 16, the minimum S = 6, and the minimum H = 8.  The first step identifies the shortest prefix mask (the /P with the smallest value of P) of /22 by adding N and S (16 + 6). \n",

      "For the number of subnet bits, S=8 does not work, because 28 = 256 < 300.  However, S=9 works, because 29 = 512 => 300.  Similarly, because 28 – 2 = 254, which is less than 300, 8 host bits are not enough but 9 host bits (29 – 2 = 510) are just enough.  These requirements do not leave enough space to number all the hosts and subnet, because the network, subnet, and host parts add up to more than 32: N=16, because as a Class B network, 16 network bits exist.  The minimum S=9, because S=8 provides too few subnets (28 = 256 < 300) but S=9 provides 29 = 512 subnets.  The minimum H=9, because H=8 provides too few hosts (28 – 2 = 254 < 280) but H=9 provides 29 – 2 = 510 hosts/subnet.  Figure 21-3 shows the resulting format for the IP addresses in this subnet, after the engineer has allocated 9 subnet bits on paper.  Only 7 host bits remain, but the engineer needs 9 host bits.  509 21 N = 16 H = 7S = 9 Minimum: H = 9 Only 7 Left!  Minimum: S = 9 Figure 21-3 Too Few Bits for the Host Part, Given the Requirements One Mask Meets Requirements The process discussed in this chapter in part focuses on finding the smallest number of subnet bits and the smallest number of host bits to meet the requirements.  If the engineer tries to use these minimum values, and the combined network, subnet, and host parts add up to exactly 32 bits, exactly one mask meets the requirements.  For example, consider a revised version of the example in the previous section, with smaller numbers of subnet and hosts, as follows: A network engineer is planning a subnet design.  The engineer plans to use Class B network 172.16.0.0.  The network has a need for 200 subnets and 180 hosts per subnet.  Which of the following masks could the engineer choose?  The three-step process to determine the numbers of network, minimum subnet, and minimum host bits results in a need for 16, 8, and 8 bits, respectively. \n",

      "NOTE The idea of calculating the number of subnets as 2S applies only in cases where a single mask is used for all subnets of a single classful network, as is being assumed in this chapter.  To effectively design masks, or to interpret masks that were chosen by someone else, you need a good working memory of the powers of 2.  Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” lists a table with powers of 2 up through 232 for your reference.  319 13 Example Design: 172.16.0.0, 200 Subnets, 200 Hosts To help make sense of the theoretical discussion so far, consider an example that focuses on the design choice for the subnet mask.  In this case, the planning and design choices so far tell us the following: ■ Use a single mask for all subnets.  ■ Plan for 200 subnets.  ■ Plan for 200 host IP addresses per subnet.  ■ Use private Class B network 172.16.0.0.  To choose the mask, the designer asks this question: How many subnet (S) bits do I need to number 200 subnets?  From Table 13-3, you can see that S = 7 is not large enough (27 = 128), but S = 8 is enough (28 = 256).  So, you need at least 8 subnet bits.  Next, the designer asks a similar question, based on the number of hosts per subnet: How many host (H) bits do I need to number 200 hosts per subnet?  The math is basically the same, but the formula subtracts 2 when counting the number of hosts/subnet.  From Table 13-3, you can see that H = 7 is not large enough (27 – 2 = 126), but H = 8 is enough (28 – 2 = 254).  Only one possible mask meets all the requirements in this case.  First, the number of network bits (N) must be 16, because the design uses a Class B network.  The requirements tell us that the mask needs at least 8 subnet bits, and at least 8 host bits.  The mask only has 32 bits in it; Figure 13-16 shows the resulting mask. \n",

All subnets are of Class A network 10.0.0.0, with two masks being used, therefore meeting the definition of VLSM.  Oddly enough, a common mistake occurs when people think that VLSM means “using more than one mask in some internetwork” rather than “using more than one mask in a single classful network.” For example, if in one internetwork diagram, all subnets of network 10.0.0.0 use a 255.255.240.0 mask, and all subnets of network 11.0.0.0 use a 255.255.255.0 mask, the design uses two different masks.  However, Class A network 10.0.0.0 uses only one mask, and Class A network 11.0.0.0 uses only one mask.  In that case, the design does not use VLSM.  VLSM provides many benefits for real networks, mainly related to how you allocate and use your IP address space.  Because a mask defines the size of the subnet (the number of host addresses in the subnet), VLSM allows engineers to better match the need for addresses with the size of the subnet.  For example, for subnets that need fewer addresses, the engineer uses a mask with fewer host bits, so the subnet has fewer host IP addresses.  This flexibility reduces the number of wasted IP addresses in each subnet. \n",

      "Global ID (Pseudo-Random) Subnet ID Interface IDSubnet 40 Bits 64 Bits16 Bits FD 8 Bits Figure 29-14 IPv6 Unique Local Unicast Address Format NOTE Just to be completely exact, IANA actually reserves prefix FC00::/7, and not FD00::/8, for these addresses.  FC00::/7 includes all addresses that begin with hex FC and FD.  However, an RFC (4193) requires the eighth bit of these addresses to be set to 1; so in practice today, the unique local addresses all begin with their first two digits as FD.  Subnetting with Unique Local IPv6 Addresses Subnetting using unique local addresses works just like subnetting with global unicast addresses with a 48-bit global routing prefix.  The only difference is that with global unicasts, you start by asking for a global routing prefix to be assigned to your company, and that global routing prefix might or might not have a /48 prefix length.  With unique local, you create that prefix locally, and the prefix begins with /48, with the first 8 bits set and the next 40 bits randomly chosen.  The process can be as simple as choosing a 40-bit value as your global ID.  40 bits requires 10 hex digits, so you can even avoid thinking in binary, and just make up a unique 10-hex-digit value.  For example, imagine you chose a 40-bit global ID of 00 0001 0001.  Your addresses must begin with the two hex digits FD, making the entire prefix be FD00:0001:0001::/48, or FD00:1:1::/48 when abbreviated.  702  To create subnets, just as you did in the earlier examples with a 48-bit global routing prefix, treat the entire fourth quartet as a subnet field, as shown in Figure 29-14.  Figure 29-15 shows an example subnetting plan using unique local addresses.

This newer prefix style mask was created around the same time as the classless interdomain routing (CIDR) specification back in the early 1990s, and the acronym CIDR grew to be used for anything related to CIDR, including prefix-style masks.  In addition, the term slash mask is sometimes used because the value includes a slash mark (/).  You need to get comfortable working with masks in different formats.  The rest of this section examines how to convert between the three formats.  Converting Between Binary and Prefix Masks Converting between binary and prefix masks should be relatively intuitive after you know that the prefix value is simply the number of binary 1s in the binary mask.  For the sake of completeness, the processes to convert in each direction are Binary to prefix: Count the number of binary 1s in the binary mask, and write the total, in decimal, after a /.  Prefix to binary: Write P binary 1s, where P is the prefix value, followed by as many binary 0s as required to create a 32-bit number.  Tables 15-2 and 15-3 show some examples. \n",

This book shows that conversion as a separate step, in Figure 16-5, mainly because many people make a mistake at this step in the process.

      "By wasting fewer addresses, more space remains to allocate more subnets.  VLSM can be helpful for both public and private IP addresses, but the benefits are more dramatic with public networks.  With public networks, the address savings help engineers avoid having to obtain another registered IP network number from regional IP address assignment authorities.  With private networks, as defined in RFC 1918, running out of addresses is not as big a negative, because you can always grab another private network from RFC 1918 if you run out.  Classless and Classful Routing Protocols Before you can deploy a VLSM design, you must first use a routing protocol that supports VLSM.  To support VLSM, the routing protocol must advertise the mask along with each subnet.  Without mask information, the router receiving the update would be confused.  For example, if a router learned a route for 10.1.8.0, but with no mask information, what does that mean?  Is that subnet 10.1.8.0/24?  10.1.8.0/23?  10.1.8.0/30?  The dotted-decimal number 10.1.8.0 happens to be a valid subnet number with a variety of masks, and because multiple masks can be used with VLSM, the router has no good way to make an educated guess.  To effectively support VLSM, the routing protocol needs to advertise the correct mask along with each subnet so that the receiving router knows the exact subnet that is being advertised.  By definition, classless routing protocols advertise the mask with each advertised route, and classful routing protocols do not.  The classless routing protocols, as noted in Table 22-2, are the newer, more advanced routing protocols.  Not only do these more advanced classless routing protocols support VLSM, but they also support manual route summarization, which allows a routing protocol to advertise one route for a larger subnet instead of multiple routes for smaller subnets .

      "313 13 However, you still need to be ready to work with variable-length subnet masks (VLSM), which is the practice of using different masks for different subnets in the same classful IP network.  All of Chapter 22, “Variable-Length Subnet Masks,” focuses on VLSM.  However, all the examples and discussion up until that chapter purposefully avoid VLSM just to keep the discussion simpler, for the sake of learning to walk before you run.  Make Design Choices Now that you know how to analyze the IP addressing and subnetting needs, the next major step examines how to apply the rules of IP addressing and subnetting to those needs and make some choices.  In other words, now that you know how many subnets you need and how many host addresses you need in the largest subnet, how do you create a useful subnetting design that meets those requirements?  The short answer is that you need to do the three tasks shown on the right side of Figure 13-10.  Design Subnets • Choose Network • Choose 1 Mask • List All Subnets Analyze Needs # Subnets # Hosts/Subnet 1 Size Subnet Figure 13-10 Input to the Design Phase, and Design Questions to Answer Choose a Classful Network In the original design for what we know of today as the Internet, companies used registered public classful IP networks when implementing TCP/IP inside the company.  By the mid 1990s, an alternative became more popular: private IP networks.  This section discusses the background behind these two choices, because it impacts the choice of what IP network a company will then subnet and implement in its enterprise internetwork.  Public IP Networks The original design of the Internet required that any company that connected to the Internet had to use a registered public IP network.  To do so, the company would complete some paperwork, describing the enterprise’s internetwork and the number of hosts existing, plus plans for growth.  After submitting the paperwork, the company would receive an assignment of either a Class A, B, or C network.  Public IP networks, and the administrative processes surrounding them, ensure that all the companies that connect to the Internet all use unique IP addresses.  In particular, after a public IP network is assigned to a company, only that company should use the addresses in that network. \n",

      "The route lists R1’s own Serial0 as the outgoing interface and R2 as the next-hop router IP address (150.150.2.7).  98  Chapter 19, “Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2,” covers routing protocols in more detail.  Next, the final major section of this chapter introduces several additional functions related to how the network layer forwards packets from source to destination through an internetwork.  Other Network Layer Features The TCP/IP network layer defines many functions beyond the function defined by the IPv4 protocol.  Sure, IPv4 plays a huge role in networking today, defining IP addressing and IP routing.  However, other protocols and standards, defined in other Requests For Comments (RFC), play an important role for network layer functions as well.  For example, routing protocols like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) exist as separate protocols, defined in separate RFCs.  This last short section of the chapter introduces three other network layer features that should be helpful to you when reading through the rest of this book.  These last three topics just help fill in a few holes, helping to give you some perspective, and helping you make sense of later discussions as well.  The three topics are ■ Domain Name System (DNS) ■ Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) ■ Ping Using Names and the Domain Name System Can you imagine a world in which every time you used an application, you had to think about the other computer and refer to it by IP address?  Instead of using easy names like google.com or facebook.com, you would have to remember and type IP addresses, like 74.125.225.5.  Certainly, that would not be user friendly and could drive some people away from using computers at all.  Thankfully, TCP/IP defines a way to use hostnames to identify other computers.  The user either never thinks about the other computer or refers to the other computer by name.  Then, protocols dynamically discover all the necessary information to allow communications based on that name. \n",

The prefix part identifies the addresses that reside in the same subnet, because all IP addresses in the same subnet have the same value in the prefix part of their addresses.  The idea is much like the postal code (ZIP codes in the United States) in mailing addresses.  All mailing addresses in the same town have the same postal code.  Likewise, all IP addresses in the same subnet have identical values in the prefix part of their addresses.  The host part of an address identifies the host uniquely inside the subnet.  If you compare any two IP addresses in the same subnet, their host parts will differ, even though the prefix parts of their addresses have the same value.  To summarize these key comparisons:   349 15 Prefix (subnet) part: Equal in all addresses in the same subnet.  Host part: Different in all addresses in the same subnet.

By definition, the number of binary 0s equals the number of host bits; in fact, that is exactly how the mask communicates the idea of the size of the host part of the addresses in a subnet.  The beginning bits in the mask equal binary 1, with those bit positions representing the combined network and subnet parts of the addresses in the subnet.  Because the network part always comes first, then the subnet part, and then the host part, the subnet mask, in binary form, cannot have interleaved 1s and 0s.  Each subnet mask has one unbroken string of binary 1s on the left, with the rest of the bits as binary 0s.  After the engineer chooses the classful network and the number of subnet and host bits in a subnet, creating the binary subnet mask is easy.  Just write down N 1s, S 1s, and then H 0s (assuming that N, S, and H represent the number of network, subnet, and host bits).  Figure 13-17 shows the mask based on the previous example, which subnets a Class B network by creating 8 subnet bits, leaving 8 host bits.  11111111 11111111 N = 16 S = 8 H = 8 11111111 00000000 Figure 13-17 Creating the Subnet Mask—Binary—Class B Network In addition to the binary mask shown in Figure 13-17, masks can also be written in two other formats: the familiar dotted-decimal notation (DDN) seen in IP addresses and an even briefer prefix notation.  Chapter 15 discusses these formats and how to convert between the different formats. \n",

      "NOTE Unfortunately, the networking world uses the terms classless and classful in a couple of different ways.  In addition to the classless and classful addressing described here, each routing protocol can be categorized as either a classless routing protocol or a classful routing protocol.  In addition, the terms classless routing and classful routing refer to some details of how Cisco routers forward (route) packets using the default route in some cases.  As a result, these terms can be easily confused and misused.  So, when you see the words classless and classful, be careful to note the context: addressing, routing, or routing protocols.  Calculations Based on the IPv4 Address Format After you know how to break an address down using both classless and classful addressing rules, you can easily calculate a couple of important facts using some basic math formulas.  351 15 First, for any subnet, after you know the number of host bits, you can calculate the number of host IP addresses in the subnet.  Next, if you know the number of subnet bits (using classful addressing concepts) and you know that only one subnet mask is used throughout the network, you can also calculate the number of subnets in the network.  The formulas just require that you know the powers of 2: Hosts in the subnet: 2H – 2, where H is the number of host bits.  Subnets in the network: 2S, where S is the number of subnet bits.  Only use this formula if only one mask is used throughout the network.  NOTE The section “Choose the Mask” in Chapter 13, “Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting,” details many concepts related to masks, including comments about this assumption of one mask throughout a single Class A, B, or C network.  The sizes of the parts of IPv4 addresses can also be calculated.  The math is basic, but the concepts are important.  Keeping in mind that IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, the two parts with classless addressing must add up to 32 (P + H = 32), and with classful addressing, the three parts must add up to 32 (N + S + H = 32).  Figure 15-8 shows the relationships. \n",

      "The process step numbering in the videos might not match the steps shown in this edition of the book.  First Subnet ID: The Zero Subnet The first step in finding all subnet IDs of one network is incredibly simple: Copy the network ID.  That is, take the Class A, B, or C network ID—in other words, the classful network ID—and write it down as the first subnet ID.  No matter what Class A, B, or C network you use, and no matter what subnet mask you use, the first (numerically lowest) subnet ID is equal to the network ID.  For example, if you begin with classful network 172.20.0.0, no matter what the mask is, the first subnet ID is 172.20.0.0.  This first subnet ID in each network goes by two special names: either subnet zero or the zero subnet.  The origin of these names is related to the fact that a network’s zero subnet, when viewed in binary, has a subnet part of all binary 0s.  In decimal, the zero subnet can be easily identified, because the zero subnet always has the exact same numeric value as the network ID itself.  In the past, engineers avoided using zero subnets because of the ambiguity with one number that could represent the entire classful network or it could represent one subnet inside the classful network.  To help control that, IOS has a global command that can be set one of two ways: ip subnet-zero, which allows the configuration of addresses in the zero subnet.  no ip subnet-zero, which prevents the configuration of addresses in the zero subnet.  Although most sites use the default setting to allow zero subnets, you can use the no ip subnet-zero command to prevent configuring addresses that are part of a zero subnet.  Example 21-1 shows how a router rejects an ip address command after changing to use no ip subnet-zero. \n",

      "While the IOS for each type of device has some differences, just because routers and switches perform different functions, IOS that runs on these switches and routers has many similarities.  Within the exams, Cisco attempts to be generic in that the exam does not ask you to make distinctions between different models of routers and switches.  This chapter looks at some topics that again apply to IOS that runs in both Cisco routers and Cisco Catalyst switches.  In particular, this chapter looks at the IOS itself: the file systems where the IOS stores files, how to upgrade IOS, and what happens when you reboot the router or switch to upgrade the IOS.  This chapter also looks at how to manage configuration files beyond simply keeping them inside router or switch memory in the startupconfig file.  This chapter also includes a brief discussion about how to recover if you lose the password for a router or switch.  Note that this chapter focuses on features on Cisco routers.  However, many of the same features work either exactly the same, or in a very similar way, on Cisco Catalyst switches.  Managing Cisco IOS Images and Upgrades IOS exists as a file—a single file—that the router then loads into RAM to use as its operating system (OS).  This first major section of the chapter works through the story of how to upgrade to a new version of IOS.  This first section has one primary purpose but many secondary purposes.  Primarily, this section shows how to upgrade IOS on a router.  As a secondary goal, this section works through a variety of small IOS features that engineers use during that upgrade process—features not covered in any detail until this point in the book.  This section explains these topics, in order: 1.  The IOS File System 2.  Upgrading IOS Images 3.  The Cisco IOS Boot Sequence The IOS File System Every OS creates file systems to store files.  A computer needs some type of permanent storage, but it needs more than just a place to store bytes.  The OS organizes the storage into a file system, which includes directories, structure, and filenames, with the associated rules. \n",

A feature set is a group of related IOS features.  For instance, voice features in a router would be in one feature set, whereas security features, like an intrusion prevention system (IPS), would be in a security feature set.  The feature set concept has a very basic business motivation: pricing.  Customers who want fewer features want to pay less.  Cisco desired more flexible pricing depending on the needs of a customer.  Using feature sets means that Cisco has to build even more IOS images.  Not only did Cisco need one IOS image per model (or model series), per IOS version and even for each release, Cisco needed a different image per combination of feature sets.  To understand the point, Figure 36-2 shows a conceptual view of seven IOS images.  Each is for the same model of router for the same software version/release.  All the images have the same basic IP functions.  Some have additional feature sets as well.

However, none of the commands in user or privileged mode changes the switch’s configuration.  Configuration mode accepts configuration commands —commands that tell the switch the details of what to do and how to do it.  Figure 6-7 illustrates the relationships among configuration mode, user EXEC mode, and privileged EXEC mode .  configure terminal end or Ctl-Z Configuration ModeUser Mode enable disable Enable Mode Figure 6-7 CLI Configuration Mode Versus EXEC Modes   139 6 Commands entered in configuration mode update the active configuration file.  These changes to the configuration occur immediately each time you press the Enter key at the end of a command.  Be careful when you enter a configuration command!  Configuration Submodes and Contexts Configuration mode itself contains a multitude of commands.  To help organize the configuration, IOS groups some kinds of configuration commands together.  To do that, when using configuration mode, you move from the initial mode—global configuration mode—into subcommand modes.  Context-setting commands move you from one configuration subcommand mode, or context, to another.  These context-setting commands tell the switch the topic about which you will enter the next few configuration commands.  More importantly, the context tells the switch the topic you care about right now, so when you use the ?  to get help, the switch gives you help about that topic only.  NOTE Context-setting is not a Cisco term.  It is just a description used here to help make sense of configuration mode.  The best way to learn about configuration submodes is to use them, but first, take a look at these upcoming examples.  For instance, the interface command is one of the most commonly used context-setting configuration commands.  For example, the CLI user could enter interface configuration mode by entering the interface FastEthernet 0/1 configuration command. \n",

      "User and Enable (Privileged) Modes All three CLI access methods covered so far (console, Telnet, and SSH) place the user in an area of the CLI called user EXEC mode.  User EXEC mode, sometimes also called user mode, allows the user to look around but not break anything.  The “EXEC mode” part of the name refers to the fact that in this mode, when you enter a command, the switch executes the command and then displays messages that describe the command’s results.  NOTE If you have not used the CLI before, you might want to experiment with the CLI from the Sim Lite product, or view the video about CLI basics.  You can find these resources on the DVD and on the companion website, as mentioned in the introduction.  Cisco IOS supports a more powerful EXEC mode called enable mode (also known as privileged mode or privileged EXEC mode).  Enable mode gets its name from the enable command, which moves the user from user mode to enable mode, as shown in Figure 6-6.  The other name for this mode, privileged mode, refers to the fact that powerful (or privileged) commands can be executed there.  For example, you can use the reload command, which tells the switch to reinitialize or reboot Cisco IOS, only from enable mode.  134  User Mode Console Telnet SSH Enable (Command) Disable (Command) Enable Mode (Privileged Mode) Figure 6-6 User and Privileged Modes NOTE If the command prompt lists the hostname followed by a >, the user is in user mode; if it is the hostname followed by the #, the user is in enable mode.  Example 6-1 demonstrates the differences between user and enable modes.  The example shows the output that you could see in a terminal emulator window, for instance, when connecting from the console.  In this case, the user sits at the user mode prompt (“Certskills1>”) and tries the reload command. \n",

      "The Static Route Does Not Appear in the IP Routing Table An ip route command can have correct syntax, accepted and added to the running-config file, and saved into the startup-config file, but never be placed into the IP routing table and seen in the output of the show ip route command.  Why?  Well, the earlier topics under headings “Static Routes with No Competing Routes” and “Static Routes with Competing Routes” explained the reasons.  For easier review and study, here are the reasons why an ip route command would be accepted when typed in the CLI, but the route would not appear in the IP routing table.  Note that all three reasons can change over time; that is, the route may not appear right now, then conditions change, and then the route appears.  ■ The outgoing interface listed in the ip route command is not up/up.  ■ The next-hop router IP address listed in the ip route command is not reachable (that is, there is no route that matches the next-hop address).  ■ A better competing route (another route to the exact same subnet ID and mask) exists, and that competing route has a better (lower) administrative distance.  The Correct Static Route Appears but Works Poorly This last section is a place to make two points, one mainstream, and one point to review a bit of trivia.  First, on the mainstream point, the static route can be perfect, but the packets from one host to the next still may not arrive.  An incorrect static route is just one of many items to check when you’re troubleshooting problems like “host A cannot connect to server B.” The  430  root cause may be the static route, or it may be something else.  Chapters 23 and 24 go into some depth about troubleshooting these types of problems.  On the more trivial point, you may recall the permanent keyword on the ip route command, as discussed earlier in the section titled “Static Routes with No Competing Routes.” Basically, this keyword tells IOS to skip the checks of the current status of the outgoing interface and the check of a route for the next-hop router IP address. \n",

      "But you can configure VLAN interfaces and assign them IP addresses for any working VLAN.  For example, Figure 8-7 shows a Layer 2 switch with some physical ports in two different VLANs (VLANs 1 and 2).  The figure also shows the subnets used on those VLANs.  The network engineer could choose to create a VLAN 1 interface, a VLAN 2 interface, or both.  In most cases, the engineer plans which VLAN to use when managing a group of switches, and creates a VLAN interface for that VLAN only.

When acting as a Layer 2 switch, a switch forwards Ethernet frames as discussed in depth in Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching.” Alternatively, a switch can also act as a multilayer switch or Layer 3 switch, which means the switch can do both Layer 2 switching and Layer 3 IP routing of IP packets, using the Layer 3 logic normally used by routers.  This chapter assumes all switches are Layer 2 switches.  Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” further defines the differences between these types of operation for LAN switches. \n",

      "If the details from Chapter 6 are not fresh in your memory, it might be worthwhile to spend a few minutes briefly reviewing Chapter 6 as well as Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” before reading further.  Cisco switches and routers share many of the same CLI navigation features, and many of the same configuration commands for management features.  ■ Many Cisco router models have an auxiliary (Aux) port, intended to be connected to an external modem and phone line to allow remote users to dial in to the router, and access the CLI, by making a phone call.  Cisco switches do not have auxiliary ports.  ■ Router IOS defaults to disallow both Telnet and SSH into the router because of the default setting of transport input none in vty configuration mode.  Chapter 8, “Configuring Basic Switch Management,” already discussed the various options on this command to enable Telnet (transport input telnet), SSH (transport input ssh), or both (transport input all or transport input telnet ssh).  The router CLI also differs from a switch CLI just because switches and routers do different things.  For example, Cisco Layer 2 switches support the show mac address-table command, but these Layer 2–only devices do not support the show ip route command, which routers use to list IPv4 routes.  Some Cisco routers can do IP routing but not Layer 2 switching, so they support the show ip route command but not the show mac address-table command.  NOTE The book includes a video that shows how to navigate the router CLI; you can find this video on the DVD and on the companion website.  Router Interfaces One minor difference between Cisco switches and routers is that routers support a much wider variety of interfaces.  Today, LAN switches support Ethernet LAN interfaces of various speeds.  Routers support a variety of other types of interfaces, including serial interfaces, cable TV, DSL, 3G/4G wireless, and others not mentioned in this book.  392  Most Cisco routers have at least one Ethernet interface of some type. \n",

      "To send the IP packet to the default router, the sender sends a data-link frame across the medium to the nearby router; this frame includes the packet in the data portion of the frame.  That frame uses data link layer (Layer 2) addressing in the data-link header to ensure that the nearby router receives the frame.  83 4 NOTE The default router is also referred to as the default gateway.  R1 and R2’s Logic: Routing Data Across the Network All routers use the same general process to route the packet.  Each router keeps an IP routing table.  This table lists IP address groupings, called IP networks and IP subnets.  When a router receives a packet, it compares the packet’s destination IP address to the entries in the routing table and makes a match.  This matching entry also lists directions that tell the router where to forward the packet next.  In Figure 4-1, R1 would have matched the destination address (168.1.1.1) to a routing table entry, which in turn told R1 to send the packet to R2 next.  Similarly, R2 would have matched a routing table entry that told R2 to send the packet, over an Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) link, to R3 next.  The routing concept works a little like driving down the freeway when approaching a big interchange.  You look up and see signs for nearby towns, telling you which exits to take to go to each town.  Similarly, the router looks at the IP routing table (the equivalent of the road signs) and directs each packet over the correct next LAN or WAN link (the equivalent of a road).  R3’s Logic: Delivering Data to the End Destination The final router in the path, R3, uses almost the same logic as R1 and R2, but with one minor difference.  R3 needs to forward the packet directly to PC2, not to some other router.  On the surface, that difference seems insignificant.  In the next section, when you read about how the network layer uses LANs and WANs, the significance of the difference will become obvious. \n",

      "A Summary of Router Forwarding Logic First, when a router receives a data-link frame addressed to that router’s data-link address, the router needs to think about processing the contents of the frame.  When such a frame arrives, the router uses the following logic on the data-link frame: Step 1.  Use the data-link Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field to ensure that the frame had no errors; if errors occurred, discard the frame.  Step 2.  Assuming that the frame was not discarded at Step 1, discard the old data-link header and trailer, leaving the IP packet.  Step 3.  Compare the IP packet’s destination IP address to the routing table, and find the route that best matches the destination address.  This route identifies the outgoing interface of the router, and possibly the next-hop router IP address.  Step 4.  Encapsulate the IP packet inside a new data-link header and trailer, appropriate for the outgoing interface, and forward the frame.  With these steps, each router forwards the packet to the next location, inside a data-link frame.  With each router repeating this process, the packet reaches its final destination.  While the router does all the steps in the list, Step 3 is the main routing or forwarding step.  The packet has a destination IP address in the header, whereas the routing table lists slightly different numbers, typically a list of networks and subnets.  To match a routing table entry, the router thinks like this: Network numbers and subnet numbers represent a group of addresses that begin with the same prefix.  Think about those numbers as groups of addresses.  In which of the groups does this packet’s destination address reside?  The next example shows specific examples of matching the routing table.  A Detailed Routing Example The routing example uses Figure 4-11.  In this example, all routers happen to use the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, and all routers know routes for all subnets.  In particular, PC2, at the bottom, sits in subnet 150.150.4.0, which consists of all addresses that begin with 150.150.4. \n",

Rest of IPv4 Network B SW1 A D Remote Local R1 Figure 18-1 Host Routing Logic Summary Routers have a little more routing work to do as compared with hosts.  While the host logic began with an IP packet sitting in memory, a router has some work to do before getting to that point.  With the following five-step summary of a router’s routing logic, the router takes the first two steps just to receive the frame and extract the IP packet, before thinking about the packet’s destination address at Step 3.  The steps are as follows: For each received data-link frame, choose whether or not to process the frame.  Process it if A.  The frame has no errors (per the data-link trailer Frame Check Sequence [FCS] field).  B.  The frame’s destination data-link address is the router’s address (or an appropriate multicast or broadcast address).  2.  If choosing to process the frame at Step 1, de-encapsulate the packet from inside the data-link frame.  3.  Make a routing decision.  To do so, compare the packet’s destination IP address to the routing table and find the route that matches the destination address.  This route identifies the outgoing interface of the router and possibly the next-hop router.  4.  Encapsulate the packet into a data-link frame appropriate for the outgoing interface.  When forwarding out LAN interfaces, use ARP as needed to find the next device’s MAC address.  5.  Transmit the frame out the outgoing interface, as listed in the matched IP route.  This routing process summary lists many details, but sometimes you can think about the routing process in simpler terms.  For example, leaving out some details, this paraphrase of the step list details the same big concepts: The router receives a frame, removes the packet from inside the frame, decides where to forward the packet, puts the packet into another frame, and sends the frame.  To give you a little more perspective on these steps, Figure 18-2 breaks down the same fivestep routing process as a diagram. \n",

      "Chapter 18 already discussed how to troubleshoot IPv4 static routes, and many of those same concepts apply to IPv6 static routes.  However, IPv6 static routes do have a few small differences.  This last part of the chapter looks at troubleshooting IPv6 static routes, reviewing many of the same troubleshooting rules applied to IPv4 static routes, while focusing on the details specific to IPv6.  This topic breaks static route troubleshooting into two perspectives: the route is in the routing table but is incorrect and cases in which the route is not in the routing table.  Troubleshooting Incorrect Static Routes That Appear in the IPv6 Routing Table A static route is only as good as the input typed into the ipv6 route command.  IOS checks the syntax of the command, of course.  However, IOS cannot tell if you choose the incorrect outgoing interface, incorrect next-hop address, or incorrect prefix/prefix-length in a static route.  If the parameters pass the syntax checks, IOS places the ipv6 route command into the running-config file.  Then, if no other problem exists (as discussed at the next heading), IOS puts the route into the IP routing table—even though the route may not work because of the poorly chosen parameters.  For instance, an exam question might show a figure with Router R1 having an address of 2001:1:1:1::1 and neighboring Router R2 with an address of 2001:1:1:1::2.  If R1 lists a static route with the command ipv6 route 3333::/64 2001:1:1:1::1, the command would be accepted by IOS with correct syntax, but it would not be effective as a route.  R1 cannot use its own IPv6 address as a next-hop address.  IOS does not prevent the configuration of the command, however; it allows the command and adds the route to the IPv6 routing table, but the route cannot possibly forward packets correctly.  When you see an exam question that has static routes, and you see them in the output of show ipv6 route, remember that the routes may have incorrect parameters. \n",

      "Troubleshooting Static Routes This entire section about static routes includes scattered comments that can help you troubleshoot static routes; however, the exam topics for this version of the exam happens to specifically mention troubleshooting for static routes.  To that end, this final topic of the chapter summarizes the key points related to troubleshooting static routes, some already mentioned in this chapter, and some added here in this section.  429 18 This topic breaks static route troubleshooting into three perspectives: the route is in the routing table but is incorrect; the route is not in the routing table; the route is in the routing table, and is correct, but the packets do not arrive.  Troubleshooting Incorrect Static Routes that Appear in the IP Routing Table This first troubleshooting item can be obvious, but it is worth pausing to think about.  A static route is only as good as the input typed into the ip route command.  IOS checks the syntax, and as mentioned earlier, makes a few other checks that this section reviews in the next heading.  But once those checks are passed, IOS puts the route into the IP routing table, even if the route had poorly chosen parameters.  For instance, an exam question might show addresses 192.168.1.101 and .102, with mask /26, and you see a router with a command ip route 192.168.1.64 255.255.255.224 192.168.1.65.  Did you see the problem immediately?  The range of addresses in subnet 192.168.1.64, with mask 255.255.255.224, does not include the .101 and .102 addresses.  So the ip route command has good syntax, but the engineer made a subnetting math mistake.  When you see an exam question that has static routes, and you see them in the output of show ip route, remember to check on these items: ■ Is there a subnetting math error in the subnet ID and mask?  ■ Is the next-hop IP address correct, and referencing an IP address on a neighboring router?  ■ Is the outgoing interface correct, and referencing an interface on the local route (that is, the same router where the static route is configured)? \n",

This second of four major sections of this chapter focuses on that core configuration and verification.  Configuring Core RIPv2 Features RIPv2 configuration is simple compared to the concepts related to routing protocols.  The configuration process uses three required commands, with only one command, the network command, requiring any real thought.  You should also know the more popular show commands for helping you analyze and troubleshoot routing protocols.  The RIPv2 configuration process takes only the following three required steps, with the possibility that the third step might need to be repeated several times on the same router:  444  Step 1. \n",

      "RIP and Routing Protocol Concepts Many IP routing protocols exist, in part due to the long history of IP.  However, if you compare all the IP routing protocols, they all have some core features in common.  Each routing protocol causes routers (and Layer 3 switches) to 1.  Learn routing information about IP subnets from other neighboring routers 2.  Advertise routing information about IP subnets to other neighboring routers 3.  If a router learns of more than one route to reach one subnet, choose the best route based on that routing protocol’s concept of a metric 4.  React to changes when the network topology changes—for example, when a link fails, and converge to use a new choice of best route for each destination subnet All the routing protocols do these same four functions, but the protocols differ in the details of how they accomplish these tasks.  The rest of this chapter works through the details of how Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2) accomplishes these tasks, with a few comments about other protocols sprinkled throughout .  History of Interior Gateway Protocols Historically speaking, RIP Version 1 (RIPv1) was the first popularly used IP routing protocol, with the Cisco proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) being introduced a little later, as shown as the first wave in Figure 19-1.  20102000 EIGRP RIP-2 1990 OSPFv2 IGRP 1980 RIP-1 1st Wave IPv4: Distance Vector 2nd Wave: IPv4 3rd Wave: IPv6 EIGRPv6 RIPng OSPFv3 OSPFv3 Address Families 4th Wave: IPv4 + IPv6 Figure 19-1 Timeline for IP IGPs By the early 1990s, business and technical factors pushed the IPv4 world toward a second wave of better routing protocols.  That second wave includes RIP Version 2 (RIPv2), OSPF Version 2 (OSPFv2), and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), all protocols found in use today for IPv4.  The first and second wave of routing protocols worked with IPv4 but not IPv6. \n",

In this case, the design does not create a discontiguous classful network, so no real problem exists.  However, changing R1 to use the auto-summary setting would cause R2 to learn a different route: R1 would advertise a route for Class C network 192.168.1.0/24 to R2, instead of a route for subnet 192.168.1.96/27.  The second half of Example 19-18 shows that route, after that change to the configurations of R1 and R2 .  466  RIP Issues Caused by Other Router Features RIP could be configured perfectly but still not work due to other issues.  This last part of the troubleshooting section takes a brief look at these other features.  First, RIP operates only on working interfaces; that is, interfaces that are in an up and up status per the show interfaces and show ip interfaces commands.  Chapter 17, “Operating Cisco Routers,” and Chapter 24, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing,” go into more detail about issues that can cause an interface to fail.  RIP requires that all neighbors on a link be in the same subnet.  That makes good sense from an IP design perspective, but it is the kind of error that can be easily created for an exam question. \n",

      "Any time an engineer thinks about what routing protocol to use, he can make some basic comparisons between the routing protocols.  The following list describes four of the major comparison points when comparing these routing protocols: ■ The underlying routing protocol algorithm: Specifically, whether the routing protocol uses logic referenced as distance vector (DV) or link state (LS).  ■ The usefulness of the metric: The routing protocol chooses which route is best based on its metric; so the better the metric, the better the choices made by that routing protocol.  ■ The speed of convergence: How long does it take all the routers to learn about a change in the network and update their IPv4 routing tables?  That concept, called convergence time, varies depending on the routing protocol.  ■ Whether the protocol is a public standard or a vendor-proprietary function: RIP and OSPF happen to be standards, defined by RFCs.  EIGRP happens to be defined by Cisco, and until 2013, was kept private.  RIP’s hop count metric treats each router as a hop, so the hop count is the number of other routers between a router and some remote subnet.  RIP’s hop-count metric means that RIP picks the route with the smallest number of links and routers.  However, that shortest route may have the slowest links.  In fact, Figure 19-2 shows just such a case on the left, with RIP choosing the one-hop route from Router B to subnet 10.1.1.0, even though it crosses the slower 100-Mbps link instead of the two-hop route over two 1-Gbps links.  A routing protocol whose metric was based (at least in part) on link bandwidth might be a better choice in the topology shown in Figure 19-2.  For example, EIGRP does base its metric in part on link bandwidth.  EIGRP, on the right side of the figure, chooses the route that happens to have more links through the network (and more hops), but both links have a faster bandwidth of 1 Gbps on each link . \n",

      "  * Top 2 answer (L2 distance: 23.20)\n",
      "  -----------------------------------\n",
      "In these cases, the metric does not help the router choose which route is best, because each routing protocol uses a metric unique to that routing protocol.  For example, RIP uses the hop count as the metric, but EIGRP uses a math formula with bandwidth and delay as inputs.  A route with RIP metric 1 might need to be compared to an EIGRP route, to the same subnet, but with metric 4,132,768.  (Yes, EIGRP metrics tend to be large numbers.)  Because the numbers have different meanings, there is no real way to compare the metrics.  The router still needs to choose the best route even between routes learned by different routing protocols, or between routing protocols and static routes.  IOS solves this problem by assigning a numeric value to each routing protocol.  IOS then chooses the route whose routing protocol has the lower number.  This number is called the administrative distance (AD).  For example, EIGRP defaults to use an AD of 90, and RIP defaults to use the value of 120, as shown in the routes in Example 19-3 and 19-4.  Given the lower-is-better logic used with administrative distance, an EIGRP route to a subnet would be chosen instead of a competing RIP route.  450  Table 19-4 lists the AD values for the most common sources of routing information.  Table 19-4 IOS Defaults for Administrative Distance Route Source Administrative Distance Connected routes 0 Static routes 1 EIGRP 90 OSPF 110 RIP (v1 and v2) 120 DHCP default route 254 Unknown or unbelievable 255 NOTE You might recall a brief mention of administrative distance in Chapter 18, “Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes.” That chapter explained how to configure a floating static route that was used only when the routing protocol did not learn a route for a given subnet, using administrative distance as the key mechanism .  Revealing RIP Configuration with the show ip protocols Command The show ip route command shows the end result of RIP’s work, but the show ip protocols command tells us something about how RIP works and about the RIP configuration. \n",

The ICND2 book’s chapters about OSPF describe link state logic, and the ICND2 book’s chapters on EIGRP get into more detail about some advanced distance vector features.  The Concept of a Distance and a Vector The term distance vector describes what a router knows about each route.  When a router learns about a route to a subnet, the routers learn three important facts related to each route: the destination subnet, the distance (that is, the routing protocol metric), and the vector (that is, the link and next-hop router to use as part of that route).  Figure 19-3 begins to develop that concept showing RIP updates in the small boxes on the left.  That is, Router R1 receives RIP updates from three neighboring routers.  Each update describes a different route for subnet X, with a different metric.  The fact that a particular router sends the RIP message identifies the next-hop router for the route. \n",

For example, Figure 20-8 shows the Network configuration screen from a user host OS (Mac OS X in this case), with all the IPv4 settings.  This particular example shows the big four settings: address, mask, router, and DNS.  Figure 20-8 IP Address, Mask, and Default Router Settings on Mac OS However , beyond these windows into the graphical user interface (GUI) of any OS, most OSs have a variety of networking commands available from a command line.  Interestingly, some of the commands are the same across many different OSs, even between Microsoft Windows versions and other OSs.  For example, to verify the IP address, mask, default router, and other settings, OSs typically support either the ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Linux and Mac OS) commands.

      "By wasting fewer addresses, more space remains to allocate more subnets.  VLSM can be helpful for both public and private IP addresses, but the benefits are more dramatic with public networks.  With public networks, the address savings help engineers avoid having to obtain another registered IP network number from regional IP address assignment authorities.  With private networks, as defined in RFC 1918, running out of addresses is not as big a negative, because you can always grab another private network from RFC 1918 if you run out.  Classless and Classful Routing Protocols Before you can deploy a VLSM design, you must first use a routing protocol that supports VLSM.  To support VLSM, the routing protocol must advertise the mask along with each subnet.  Without mask information, the router receiving the update would be confused.  For example, if a router learned a route for 10.1.8.0, but with no mask information, what does that mean?  Is that subnet 10.1.8.0/24?  10.1.8.0/23?  10.1.8.0/30?  The dotted-decimal number 10.1.8.0 happens to be a valid subnet number with a variety of masks, and because multiple masks can be used with VLSM, the router has no good way to make an educated guess.  To effectively support VLSM, the routing protocol needs to advertise the correct mask along with each subnet so that the receiving router knows the exact subnet that is being advertised.  By definition, classless routing protocols advertise the mask with each advertised route, and classful routing protocols do not.  The classless routing protocols, as noted in Table 22-2, are the newer, more advanced routing protocols.  Not only do these more advanced classless routing protocols support VLSM, but they also support manual route summarization, which allows a routing protocol to advertise one route for a larger subnet instead of multiple routes for smaller subnets .

Analyzing Switch Interface Status and Statistics This section makes the transition from the process focus of the previous section to the first of four technology-focused sections of this chapter.  That process begins with finding out whether each switch interface works, and if working, whether any statistics reveal any additional problems.  Unsurprisingly, Cisco switches do not use interfaces at all unless the interface is first considered to be in a functional or working state.  In addition, the switch interface might be in a working state, but intermittent problems might still be occurring.  This section begins by looking at the Cisco switch interface status codes and what they mean so that you can know whether an interface is working.  The rest of this section then looks at those more unusual cases in which the interface is working, but not working well, as revealed by different interface status codes and statistics.  Interface Status Codes and Reasons for Nonworking States Cisco switches actually use two different sets of interface status codes—one set of two codes (words) that use the same conventions as do router interface status codes, and another set with a single code (word).  Both sets of status codes can determine whether an interface is working.  The switch show interfaces and show interfaces description commands list the two-code status named the line status and protocol status.  The line status generally refers to whether Layer 1 is working, with protocol status generally referring to whether Layer 2 is working.  NOTE This book refers to these two status codes in shorthand by just listing the two codes with a slash between them, such as up/up.  The single-code interface status corresponds to different combinations of the traditional two-code interface status codes and can be easily correlated to those codes.  For example, the show interfaces status command lists a connected state for working interfaces, with the same meaning as the up/up state seen with the show interfaces and show interfaces description commands.  Table 12-2 lists the code combinations and some root causes that could have caused a particular interface status. \n",

This chapter looks at some topics that again apply to IOS that runs in both Cisco routers and Cisco Catalyst switches.

This chapter also looks at how to manage configuration files beyond simply keeping them inside router or switch memory in the startupconfig file.  This chapter also includes a brief discussion about how to recover if you lose the password for a router or switch.  Note that this chapter focuses on features on Cisco routers.  However, many of the same features work either exactly the same, or in a very similar way, on Cisco Catalyst switches.

This first major section of the chapter works through the story of how to upgrade to a new version of IOS.  This first section has one primary purpose but many secondary purposes.  Primarily, this section shows how to upgrade IOS on a router.

      "Instead, named ACLs and ACL sequence numbers make it easier to remember ACL names and edit existing ACLs when an ACL needs to change.  Named IP Access Lists Named IP ACLs have many similarities with numbered IP ACLs.  They can be used for filtering packets, plus for many other purposes.  They can match the same fields as well: Standard numbered ACLs can match the same fields as a standard named ACL, and extended numbered ACLs can match the same fields as an extended named ACL.  Of course, there are differences between named and numbered ACLs.  Named ACLs originally had three big differences compared to numbered ACLs: ■ Using names instead of numbers to identify the ACL, making it easier to remember the reason for the ACL ■ Using ACL subcommands, not global commands, to define the action and matching parameters ■ Using ACL editing features that allow the CLI user to delete individual lines from the ACL and insert new lines You can easily learn named ACL configuration by just converting numbered ACLs to use the equivalent named ACL configuration.

Beginning with the original standard numbered IP ACLs in the early days of IOS, which could enable the   597 25 logic shown earlier around Figure 25-2, Cisco has added many ACL features, including the following: ■ Standard numbered ACLs (1–99) ■ Extended numbered ACLs (100–199) ■ Additional ACL numbers (1300–1999 standard, 2000–2699 extended) ■ Named ACLs ■ Improved editing with sequence numbers This chapter focuses solely on standard numbered IP ACLs, while the next chapter discusses the other three primary categories of IP ACLs.  Briefly, IP ACLs will be either numbered or named in that the configuration identifies the ACL either using a number or a name.  ACLs will also be either standard or extended, with extended ACLs having much more robust abilities in matching packets.  Figure 25-3 summarizes the big ideas related to categories of IP ACLs .

Port Others Standard: Matching Source IP Extended Numbered Extended Named Standard Numbered Standard Named Figure 25-3 Comparisons of IP ACL Types Standard Numbered IPv4 ACLs The title of this section serves as a great introduction, if you can decode what Cisco means by each specific word.  This section is about a type of Cisco filter (ACL) that matches only the source IP address of the packet (standard), is configured to identify the ACL using numbers rather than names (numbered), and looks at IPv4 packets.  This section examines the particulars of standard numbered IP ACLs.  First, it examines the idea that one ACL is a list, and what logic that list uses.  Following that, the text closely looks at how to match the source IP address field in the packet header, including the syntax of the commands.  This section ends with a complete look at the configuration and verification commands to implement standard ACLs . \n",

      "Or you can use the keyword ip, which means “all IPv4 packets.” You also must configure some values for the source and destination IP address fields that follow; these fields use the same syntax and options for matching the IP addresses as discussed in Chapter 25, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists.” Figure 26-3 shows the syntax.

Figure 26-3 Extended ACL Syntax, with Required Fields NOTE When matching IP addresses in the source and destination fields, there is one difference with standard ACLs: When matching a specific IP address, the extended ACL requires the use of the host keyword.  You cannot simply list the IP address alone.  Table 26-2 lists several sample access-list commands that use only the required matching parameters.  Feel free to cover the right side and use the table for an exercise, or just review the explanations to get an idea for the logic in some sample commands.

      "Analyze the ACLs to predict which packets should match the ACL, focusing on the following points : A. Misordered ACLs: Look for misordered ACL statements.  IOS uses first match logic when searching an ACL.  B.  Reversed source/destination addresses: Analyze the router interface, the direction in which the ACL is enabled, compared to the location of the IP address ranges matched by the ACL statements.  Make sure the source IP address field could match packets with that source IP address, rather than the destination, and vice versa for the destination IP address field.  C. Reversed source/destination ports: For extended ACLs that reference UDP or TCP port numbers, continue to analyze the location and direction of the ACL versus the hosts, focusing on which host acts as the server using a well-known port.  Ensure that the ACL statement matches the correct source or destination port depending on whether the server sent or will receive the packet.  D. Syntax: Remember that extended ACL commands must use the tcp and udp keywords if the command needs to check the port numbers.  E. Syntax: Note that ICMP packets do not use UDP or TCP; ICMP is considered to be another protocol matchable with the icmp keyword (instead of tcp or udp).  F. Explicit deny any: Instead of using the implicit deny any at the end of each ACL, use an explicit configuration command to deny all traffic at the end of the ACL so that the show command counters increment when that action is taken.  G. Dangerous inbound ACLs: Watch for inbound ACLs, especially those with deny all logic at the end of the ACL.  These ACLs may discard incoming overhead protocols, like routing protocol messages.  633 26 H. Standard ACL location: Standard ACLs enabled close to the source of matched addresses can discard the packets as intended, but also discard packets that should be allowed through.  Always pay close attention to the requirements of the ACL in these cases.  This chapter (and the previous) have already discussed the details of Step 3. \n",

      "Instead, named ACLs and ACL sequence numbers make it easier to remember ACL names and edit existing ACLs when an ACL needs to change.  Named IP Access Lists Named IP ACLs have many similarities with numbered IP ACLs.  They can be used for filtering packets, plus for many other purposes.  They can match the same fields as well: Standard numbered ACLs can match the same fields as a standard named ACL, and extended numbered ACLs can match the same fields as an extended named ACL.  Of course, there are differences between named and numbered ACLs.  Named ACLs originally had three big differences compared to numbered ACLs: ■ Using names instead of numbers to identify the ACL, making it easier to remember the reason for the ACL ■ Using ACL subcommands, not global commands, to define the action and matching parameters ■ Using ACL editing features that allow the CLI user to delete individual lines from the ACL and insert new lines You can easily learn named ACL configuration by just converting numbered ACLs to use the equivalent named ACL configuration.  Figure 26-10 shows just such a conversion, using a simple three-line standard ACL number 1.  To create the three permit subcommands for the named ACL, you literally copy parts of the three numbered ACL commands, beginning with the permit keyword .  626  access-list 1 permit 1.1.1.1 access-list 1 permit 3.3.3.3 access-list 1 permit 2.2.2.2 permit 1.1.1.1 permit 3.3.3.3 permit 2.2.2.2 Numbered ACL Named ACL ip access-list standard name Figure 26-10 Named ACL Versus Numbered ACL Configuration The only truly new part of the named ACL configuration is the ip access-list global configuration command.  This command defines whether an ACL is a standard or extended ACL, and defines the name.  It also moves the user to ACL configuration mode, as shown in upcoming Example 26-4.  Once in ACL configuration mode, you configure permit, deny, and remark commands that mirror the syntax of numbered ACL access-list commands. \n",

      "By wasting fewer addresses, more space remains to allocate more subnets.  VLSM can be helpful for both public and private IP addresses, but the benefits are more dramatic with public networks.  With public networks, the address savings help engineers avoid having to obtain another registered IP network number from regional IP address assignment authorities.  With private networks, as defined in RFC 1918, running out of addresses is not as big a negative, because you can always grab another private network from RFC 1918 if you run out.  Classless and Classful Routing Protocols Before you can deploy a VLSM design, you must first use a routing protocol that supports VLSM.  To support VLSM, the routing protocol must advertise the mask along with each subnet.  Without mask information, the router receiving the update would be confused.  For example, if a router learned a route for 10.1.8.0, but with no mask information, what does that mean?  Is that subnet 10.1.8.0/24?  10.1.8.0/23?  10.1.8.0/30?  The dotted-decimal number 10.1.8.0 happens to be a valid subnet number with a variety of masks, and because multiple masks can be used with VLSM, the router has no good way to make an educated guess.  To effectively support VLSM, the routing protocol needs to advertise the correct mask along with each subnet so that the receiving router knows the exact subnet that is being advertised.  By definition, classless routing protocols advertise the mask with each advertised route, and classful routing protocols do not.  The classless routing protocols, as noted in Table 22-2, are the newer, more advanced routing protocols.  Not only do these more advanced classless routing protocols support VLSM, but they also support manual route summarization, which allows a routing protocol to advertise one route for a larger subnet instead of multiple routes for smaller subnets .

      "These simpler old routing protocols just got confused when a classful network became discontiguous, because of a required feature of classful routing protocols called autosummarization.  Today, most enterprises use OSPF or EIGRP, or in a few cases, RIPv2.  All these protocols are classless routing protocols.  These classless routing protocols either do not have a problem with discontiguous classful networks or can be configured so they do not have a problem.  In fact, when using RIPv2, if you simply configure the no auto-summary RIP subcommand on every router, you can avoid the problem altogether.  But of course, it helps to understand what the problem is as well, so this section looks at both autosummarization and the discontiguous network problem.  A routing protocol that uses autosummarization automatically creates a summary route under certain conditions.  That automatic process happens when ■ That one router connects to subnets of multiple different classful networks ■ That router uses a routing protocol that uses the autosummary feature.  (Note that class ful routing protocols had to use this feature and could not disable it.)  To see specifically what that means, consider Figure 19-12, which shows one router (R3) that connects to several subnets of network 10.0.0.0 on the right and to a serial link in network 172.16.0.0 on the left.  In other words, R3 meets the first criteria in the list.  If using a routing protocol with the autosummarization feature, R3, when advertising a route to the left toward R2, would automatically create a summary route: a route for the entire Class A network 10.0.0.0, as shown in the figure .

      "313 13 However, you still need to be ready to work with variable-length subnet masks (VLSM), which is the practice of using different masks for different subnets in the same classful IP network.  All of Chapter 22, “Variable-Length Subnet Masks,” focuses on VLSM.  However, all the examples and discussion up until that chapter purposefully avoid VLSM just to keep the discussion simpler, for the sake of learning to walk before you run.  Make Design Choices Now that you know how to analyze the IP addressing and subnetting needs, the next major step examines how to apply the rules of IP addressing and subnetting to those needs and make some choices.  In other words, now that you know how many subnets you need and how many host addresses you need in the largest subnet, how do you create a useful subnetting design that meets those requirements?  The short answer is that you need to do the three tasks shown on the right side of Figure 13-10.  Design Subnets • Choose Network • Choose 1 Mask • List All Subnets Analyze Needs # Subnets # Hosts/Subnet 1 Size Subnet Figure 13-10 Input to the Design Phase, and Design Questions to Answer Choose a Classful Network In the original design for what we know of today as the Internet, companies used registered public classful IP networks when implementing TCP/IP inside the company.  By the mid 1990s, an alternative became more popular: private IP networks.  This section discusses the background behind these two choices, because it impacts the choice of what IP network a company will then subnet and implement in its enterprise internetwork.  Public IP Networks The original design of the Internet required that any company that connected to the Internet had to use a registered public IP network.  To do so, the company would complete some paperwork, describing the enterprise’s internetwork and the number of hosts existing, plus plans for growth.  After submitting the paperwork, the company would receive an assignment of either a Class A, B, or C network.  Public IP networks, and the administrative processes surrounding them, ensure that all the companies that connect to the Internet all use unique IP addresses.  In particular, after a public IP network is assigned to a company, only that company should use the addresses in that network. \n",

      "The two companies can even use the exact same IP addresses inside network 10.0.0.0.  And amazingly, at the same time, both companies can even communicate with each other through the Internet.  The technology called Network Address Translation makes it possible for companies to reuse the same IP networks, as shown in Figure 13-12.  NAT does this by translating the IP addresses inside the packets as they go from the enterprise to the Internet, using a small number of public IP addresses to support tens of thousands of private IP addresses.  That one bit of information is not enough to understand how NAT works; however, to keep the focus on subnetting, the book defers the discussion of how NAT works until Chapter 27.  For now, accept that most companies use NAT, and therefore, they can use private IP networks for their internetworks.  Private IP Networks Request For Comments (RFC) 1918 defines the set of private IP networks, as listed in Table 13-2.  By definition, these private IP networks ■ Will never be assigned to an organization as a public IP network ■ Can be used by organizations that will use NAT when sending packets into the Internet ■ Can also be used by organizations that never need to send packets into the Internet So, when using NAT—and almost every organization that connects to the Internet uses NAT—the company can simply pick one or more of the private IP networks from the list of reserved private IP network numbers.  RFC 1918 defines the list, which is summarized in Table 13-2.  Table 13-2 RFC 1918 Private Address Space Class of Networks Private IP Networks Number of Networks A 10.0.0.0 1 B 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0 16 C 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0 256  316  NOTE According to an informal survey I ran on my blog a few years back, about half of the respondents said that their networks use private Class A network 10.0.0.0, as opposed to other private networks or public networks.

Most new enterprise internetworks use private IP addresses throughout the network, along with NAT, as part of the connection to the Internet. \n",

      "These CIDR blocks act very much like a public IP network, in particular, they give each company a consecutive set of public IPv4 addresses to use.  The public address assignment process has much less waste than before as well.  In fact, most public address assignments for the last 20 years have been a CIDR block rather than an entire class A, B, or C network.  Note that Appendix N, “Classless Inter-domain Routing” provides a more detailed explanation of the terms, process, and math related to CIDR block assignment.  Private Addressing Some computers might never be connected to the Internet.  These computers’ IP addresses could be duplicates of registered IP addresses in the Internet.  When designing the IP addressing convention for such a network, an organization could pick and use any network   647 27 number(s) it wanted, and all would be well.  For example, you can buy a few routers, connect them in your office, and configure IP addresses in network 1.0.0.0, and it would work.  The IP addresses you use might be duplicates of real IP addresses in the Internet, but if all you want to do is learn on the lab in your office, everything will be fine.  When building a private network that will have no Internet connectivity, you can use IP network numbers called private internets , as defined in RFC 1918, Address Allocation for Private Internets.  This RFC defines a set of networks that will never be assigned to any organization as a registered network number.  Instead of using someone else’s registered network numbers, you can use numbers in a range that are not used by anyone else in the public Internet.

      "The result: That company uses addresses that are unique across the globe as well.  The second IPv6 option uses unique local IPv6 addresses, which work more like the IPv4 private addresses.  Companies that do not plan to connect to the Internet, and companies that plan to use IPv6 NAT, can use these private unique local addresses.  The process also   693 29 works similarly to IPv4: The engineer can read the details in an RFC, pick some numbers, and start assigning IPv6 addresses, without having to register with IANA or any other authority.  The following lists summarizes the comparisons between global unicast addresses and unique local addresses: Global unicast: Addresses that work like public IPv4 addresses.  The organization that needs IPv6 addresses asks for a registered IPv6 address block, which is assigned as a global routing prefix.  After that, only that organization uses the addresses inside that block of addresses; that is, the addresses that begin with the assigned prefix.  Unique local: Works somewhat like private IPv4 addresses, with the possibility that multiple organizations use the exact same addresses, and with no requirement for registering with any numbering authority.  The rest of this first major section of the chapter examines global unicast addresses in more detail, while the second major section of the chapter examines unique local addresses.  NOTE Just for completeness sake, note that you might also find documentation about another range of addresses called site local.  These addresses, defined by prefix FEC0::/10 (so that they begin with FEC, FED, FEE, or FEF), were originally intended to be used like IPv4 private addresses.  They have now been removed from the IPv6 standards.  The IPv6 Global Routing Prefix IPv6 global unicast addresses allow IPv6 to work more like the original design of the IPv4 Internet.  In other words, each organization asks for a block of IPv6 addresses, which no one else can use.  That organization further subdivides the address block into smaller chunks, called subnets.  Finally, to choose what IPv6 address to use for any host, the engineer chooses an address from the right subnet. \n",

      "NAT Troubleshooting The majority of NAT troubleshooting issues relate to getting the configuration correct.  Source NAT has several configuration options—static, dynamic, PAT—with several configuration commands for each.  So work hard at building skills with the configuration so you can quickly recognize configuration mistakes.  The following troubleshooting checklist summarizes the most common source NAT issues, most of which relate to incorrect configuration.  Reversed inside and outside: Ensure that the configuration includes the ip nat inside and ip nat outside interface subcommands, and that the commands are not reversed (the ip nat inside command on outside interfaces, and vice versa).  With source NAT, only the inside interface triggers IOS to add new translations, so designating the correct inside interfaces is particularly important.  Static NAT: Check the ip nat inside source static command to ensure it lists the inside local address first, and the inside global IP address second.  Dynamic NAT (ACL): Ensure that the ACL configured to match packets sent by the inside hosts match that host’s packets, before any NAT translation has occurred.  For example, if an inside local address of 10.1.1.1 should be translated to 200.1.1.1, ensure that the ACL matches source address 10.1.1.1, not 200.1.1.1.  Dynamic NAT (pool): For dynamic NAT without PAT, ensure that the pool has enough IP addresses.  When not using PAT, each inside host consumes one IP address from the pool.  A large or growing value in the second misses counter in the show ip nat statistics command output can indicate this problem.  Also, compare the configured pool to the   663 27 list of addresses in the NAT translation table ( show ip nat translations).  Finally, if the pool is small, the problem may be that the configuration intended to use PAT, and is missing the overload keyword (see next item).  PAT: It is easy to forget to add the overload option on the end of ip nat inside source list command.

      "Because the design calls for two hosts, 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2, to have Internet access, two ip nat inside commands are needed.  After creating the static NAT entries, the router needs to know which interfaces are “inside” and which are “outside.” The ip nat inside and ip nat outside interface subcommands identify each interface appropriately.  A couple of show commands list the most important information about NAT.  The show ip nat translations command lists the two static NAT entries created in the configuration.  The show ip nat statistics command lists statistics, listing things such as the number of currently active translation table entries.  The statistics also include the number of hits, which increments for every packet for which NAT must translate addresses.  Dynamic NAT Configuration As you might imagine, dynamic NAT configuration differs in some ways from static NAT, but it has some similarities as well.  Dynamic NAT still requires that each interface be identified as either an inside or outside interface, and of course static mapping is no longer required.  Dynamic NAT uses an access control list (ACL) to identify which inside local (private) IP addresses need to have their addresses translated, and it defines a pool of registered public IP addresses to allocate.  The specific steps are as follows: Step 1.  Use the ip nat inside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).  Step 2.  Use the ip nat outside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the outside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).  Step 3.

      "It picks the first one available (200.1.1.1, in this case) and adds it to the NAT table to complete the entry.  4.  The NAT router translates the source IP address and forwards the packet.  The dynamic entry stays in the table as long as traffic flows occasionally.  You can configure a timeout value that defines how long the router should wait, having not translated any packets with that address, before removing the dynamic entry.  You can also manually clear the dynamic entries from the table using the clear ip nat translation * command.  NAT can be configured with more IP addresses in the inside local address list than in the inside global address pool.  The router allocates addresses from the pool until all are allocated.  If a new packet arrives from yet another inside host, and it needs a NAT entry, but all the pooled IP addresses are in use, the router simply discards the packet.  The user must try again until a NAT entry times out, at which point the NAT function works for the next host that sends a packet.  Essentially, the inside global pool of addresses needs to be as large as the maximum number of concurrent hosts that need to use the Internet at the same time— unless you use PAT, as is explained in the next section.  652  Overloading NAT with Port Address Translation Some networks need to have most, if not all, IP hosts reach the Internet.  If that network uses private IP addresses, the NAT router needs a very large set of registered IP addresses.  With static NAT, for each private IP host that needs Internet access, you need a publicly registered IP address, completely defeating the goal of reducing the number of public IPv4 addresses needed for that organization.  Dynamic NAT lessens the problem to some degree, because every single host in an internetwork should seldom need to communicate with the Internet at the same time.  However, if a large percentage of the IP hosts in a network will need Internet access throughout that company’s normal business hours, NAT still requires a large number of registered IP addresses, again failing to reduce IPv4 address consumption.  The NAT Overload feature, also called Port Address Translation (PAT), solves this problem. \n",

A couple of show commands list the most important information about NAT.  The show ip nat translations command lists the two static NAT entries created in the configuration.  The show ip nat statistics command lists statistics, listing things such as the number of currently active translation table entries.  The statistics also include the number of hits, which increments for every packet for which NAT must translate addresses.  Dynamic NAT Configuration As you might imagine, dynamic NAT configuration differs in some ways from static NAT, but it has some similarities as well.  Dynamic NAT still requires that each interface be identified as either an inside or outside interface, and of course static mapping is no longer required.  Dynamic NAT uses an access control list (ACL) to identify which inside local (private) IP addresses need to have their addresses translated, and it defines a pool of registered public IP addresses to allocate.  The specific steps are as follows: Step 1.  Use the ip nat inside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).  Step 2.  Use the ip nat outside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the outside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).  Step 3.  Configure an ACL that matches the packets entering inside interfaces for which NAT should be performed.  Config Checklist  656  Step 4.  Use the ip nat pool name first-address last-address netmask subnet-mask command in global configuration mode to configure the pool of public registered IP addresses.  Step 5.  Use the ip nat inside source list acl-number pool pool-name command in global configuration mode to enable dynamic NAT. \n",

      "It picks the first one available (200.1.1.1, in this case) and adds it to the NAT table to complete the entry.  4.  The NAT router translates the source IP address and forwards the packet.  The dynamic entry stays in the table as long as traffic flows occasionally.  You can configure a timeout value that defines how long the router should wait, having not translated any packets with that address, before removing the dynamic entry.  You can also manually clear the dynamic entries from the table using the clear ip nat translation * command.  NAT can be configured with more IP addresses in the inside local address list than in the inside global address pool.  The router allocates addresses from the pool until all are allocated.  If a new packet arrives from yet another inside host, and it needs a NAT entry, but all the pooled IP addresses are in use, the router simply discards the packet.  The user must try again until a NAT entry times out, at which point the NAT function works for the next host that sends a packet.  Essentially, the inside global pool of addresses needs to be as large as the maximum number of concurrent hosts that need to use the Internet at the same time— unless you use PAT, as is explained in the next section.  652  Overloading NAT with Port Address Translation Some networks need to have most, if not all, IP hosts reach the Internet.  If that network uses private IP addresses, the NAT router needs a very large set of registered IP addresses.  With static NAT, for each private IP host that needs Internet access, you need a publicly registered IP address, completely defeating the goal of reducing the number of public IPv4 addresses needed for that organization.  Dynamic NAT lessens the problem to some degree, because every single host in an internetwork should seldom need to communicate with the Internet at the same time.  However, if a large percentage of the IP hosts in a network will need Internet access throughout that company’s normal business hours, NAT still requires a large number of registered IP addresses, again failing to reduce IPv4 address consumption.  The NAT Overload feature, also called Port Address Translation (PAT), solves this problem. \n",

      "At the same time, IPv6 handles the details differently; for example, using a 128-bit IPv6 address rather than the 32-bit IPv4 address.  This chapter focuses on the core network layer functions of addressing and routing.  The first section of this chapter looks at the big concepts, while the second section looks at the specifics of how to write and type IPv6 addresses.  IPv6 IP version 6 (IPv6) serves as the replacement protocol for IP version 4 (IPv4).  Unfortunately, that one bold statement creates more questions than it answers.  Why does IPv4 need to be replaced?  If IPv4 needs to be replaced, when will that happen—and will it happen quickly?  What exactly happens when a company or the Internet replaces IPv4 with IPv6?  And the list goes on.  While this introductory chapter cannot get into every detail of why IPv4 needs to eventually be replaced by IPv6, the clearest and most obvious reason for migrating TCP/IP networks to use IPv6 is growth.  IPv4 uses a 32-bit address, which totals to a few billion addresses.  Interestingly, that seemingly large number of addresses is too small.  IPv6 increases the address to 128 bits in length.  For perspective, IPv6 supplies more than 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times as many addresses as IPv4.  The fact that IPv6 uses a different size address field, with some different addressing rules, means that many other protocols and functions change as well.  For example, IPv4 routing—in other words, the packet-forwarding process—relies on an understanding of IPv4 addresses.  To support IPv6 routing, routers must understand IPv6 addresses and routing.  To dynamically learn routes for IPv6 subnets, routing protocols must support these different IPv6 addressing rules, including rules about how IPv6 creates subnets.  As a result, the migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is much more than changing one protocol (IP), but it impacts many protocols. \n",

      "These events are significant in that the day has finally come in which new companies can attempt to connect to the Internet, but they can no longer simply use IPv4, ignoring IPv6.  Their only option will be IPv6, because IPv4 has no public addresses left.  NOTE You can track ARIN’s progress through this interesting transition in the history of the Internet at its IPv4 address depletion site: http://teamarin.net/category/ ipv4-depletion/.  Even though the press has rightfully made a big deal about running out of IPv4 addresses, those who care about the Internet knew about this potential problem since the late 1980s.  The problem, generally called the IPv4 address exhaustion problem, could literally have caused the huge growth of the Internet in the 1990s to have come to a screeching halt!  Something had to be done.  The IETF came up with several short-term solutions to make IPv4 addresses last longer, and one long-term solution: IPv6.  NAT and CIDR, the short-term solutions discussed in Chapter 27, “Network Address Translation,” helped extend IPv4’s life another couple of decades.  IPv6 creates a more permanent and long-lasting solution, replacing IPv4, with a new IPv6 header and new IPv6 addresses.  The address size supports a huge number of addresses, solving the address shortage problem for generations (we hope).  Figure 28-2 shows some of the major address exhaustion timing .  ???

      "How do you do that in the presence of an IP addressing and subnetting plan, requiring you to apply all that subnetting math from Part IV of this book and from the last few chapters?  This chapter and the next start to answer some of those questions.  In particular, this chapter focuses on IP troubleshooting tools, with two in particular: ping and traceroute.  Both tools test the IPv4 data plane; that is, the ability of each networking device to route or forward IPv4 packets.  A problem with routing is often a symptom but not a root cause, with the root cause then being other problems, like interface failures, routing protocol issues, misconfiguration of various features, and the like.  The chapter ends with a short discussion of two other router tools that can also be useful for troubleshooting: Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH).  “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz The troubleshooting chapters of this book pull in concepts from many other chapters.  In fact, troubleshooting IPv4 may be one of the most important topics to learn for both the CCENT and CCNA R&S certifications.  So, it is useful to read this chapter (and the next chapter, also about troubleshooting IPv4 networks) regardless of your current knowledge level.  For these reasons, some troubleshooting chapters do not include a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz.  Foundation Topics Problem Isolation Using the ping Command Someone sends you an email or text, or a phone message, asking you to look into a user’s network problem.  You Secure Shell (SSH) to a router and issue a ping command that works.  What does that result rule out as a possible reason for the problem?  What does it rule in as still being a possible root cause?  Then you issue another ping to another address, and this time the ping fails.  Again, what does the failure of that ping command tell you?  What parts of IPv4 routing may still be a problem, and what parts do you now know are not a problem?  The ping command gives us one of the most common network troubleshooting tools. \n",

Keeping the discussion general for now, IPv6 uses these ideas the same way as IPv4: ■ To be able to build and send IPv6 packets out an interface, end-user devices need an IPv6 address on that interface.  ■ End-user hosts need to know the IPv6 address of a default router, to which the host sends IPv6 packets if the host is in a different subnet.  ■ IPv6 routers de-encapsulate and re-encapsulate each IPv6 packet when routing the packet.  ■ IPv6 routers make routing decisions by comparing the IPv6 packet’s destination address to the router’s IPv6 routing table; the matched route lists directions of where to send the IPv6 packet next.  NOTE You could take the preceding list, and replace every instance of IPv6 with IPv4, and all the statements would be true of IPv4 as well.  While the list shows some concepts that should be familiar from IPv4, the next few figures show the concepts with an example.  First, Figure 28-4 shows a few settings on a host.  The host (PC1) has an address of 2345::1.  PC1 also knows its default gateway of 2345::2.  (Both values are valid abbreviations for real IPv6 addresses.)

Today, most data-link frames carry either an IPv4 packet or an IPv6 packet.  To route an IPv6 packet, a router must use its IPv6 routing table instead of the IPv4 routing table.

      "For example, frames sent to the router’s unicast MAC address for that interface are clearly sent to that router.  However, a router can actually receive a frame sent to some other unicast MAC address, and routers should ignore these frames.  For example, routers will receive some unicast frames sent to other devices in the VLAN just because of how LAN switches work.  Think back to how LAN switches forward unknown unicast frames: frames for which the switch does not list the destination MAC address in the MAC address table.  The LAN switch floods those frames.  The result?  Routers sometimes receive frames destined for some other device, with some other device’s MAC address listed as the destination MAC address.  Routers should ignore those frames.  410  In this example, host A sends a frame destined for R1’s MAC address.  So, after the frame is received, and after R1 confirms with the FCS that no errors occurred, R1 confirms that the frame is destined for R1’s MAC address (0200.0101.0101 in this case).  All checks have been passed, so R1 will process the frame, as shown in Figure 18-5.

      "For instance, each IPv6 routing protocol has a unique multicast address, so that packets sent to that address can be ignored by all IPv6 hosts and even ignored by routers that do not run that routing protocol.  IPv6 also defines a scope for multicast packets; that is, IPv6 defines how far into the network a multicast packet should be forwarded.  Multicast addresses that begin FF08 (FF08::/16) have a link-local scope, meaning that routers will not forward these packets outside the local subnet—which is good.  Many control plane protocols need to send messages that stay on the local subnet, so these link-local multicasts play an important role.  In comparison, the addresses that begin FF08 (Ff08::/16), typically used for a multicast application with users throughout the enterprise, have an organization-local scope, meaning that packets sent to these addresses are forwarded throughout the organization but not out into the Internet.  The best way to get a sense of these link-local multicast addresses is to look at popular addresses and their use.  For instance, IPv6 reserves an address used to communicate with all IPv6 devices in a subnet, or all routers in a subnet, or all OSPF routers in a subnet, and so on.  720  Table 30-3 lists the most common local-scope IPv6 multicast addresses. \n",

      "IOS chooses the link-local address for the interface based on the following rules: ■ If configured, the router uses the value in the ipv6 address address link-local interface subcommand.  Note that the configured link-local address must be from the correct address range for link-local addresses; that is, an address from prefix FE80::/10.  In other words, the address must begin with FE8, FE9, FEA, or FEB. ■ If not configured, the IOS calculates the link-local address using EUI-64 rules, as discussed and demonstrated in and around Example 30-7.  The calculation uses EUI-64 rules even if the interface unicast address does not use EUI-64.  Routing IPv6 with Only Link-Local Addresses on an Interface Also, note that Cisco routers can enable IPv6 on an interface without using a global unicast address at all using the ipv6 enable command.  Most of the time, the ipv6 address address prefix interface subcommand both enables IPv6 on an interface and defines a global unicast address for that interface.  The ipv6 enable interface subcommand simply enables IPv6 on the interface.  The ipv6 enable interface subcommand makes a router interface relatively functional in some cases.  It always causes the router to create a link-local address, and to be ready to process IPv6 packets on that interface.  In some cases, that is all the router needs for IPv6 addressing on the interface.  Router WAN links often do not need to use subnets of global unicast addresses.  For example, consider the simple IPv6 network in Figure 30-10.  The LAN on the left and right, where IPv6 hosts exist, needs a global unicast subnet to use so that the hosts can have a unique IPv6 address.  However, the two routers connected to the WAN link do not need global unicast addresses.  As discussed earlier around Figure 30-8, the next-hop router in an IPv6 route is the neighbor’s link-local address. \n",

      "This last bullet item gets to the key function of these solicited-node multicast addresses.  Packets sent to a particular solicited-node multicast address might be processed by just one host, or it might be processed by multiple hosts.  If more than one host in a subnet happens to have equal values in the last six hex digits of its unicast addresses, they calculate and use the same solicited-node multicast address.  And some protocols want this kind of logic of sending one multicast packet to all hosts that happen to have these similar unicast IPv6 addresses.  As a result, the solicited-node multicast address was born.  All IPv6 hosts must listen for messages sent to their solicited-node multicast address(es).  So, for each interface and for each unicast address on each interface, the device must determine its solicited-node multicast address(es) and listen for packets sent to those addresses.  The logic to find a solicited-node multicast address, after you know the unicast address, is simple.  Start with the predefined /104 prefix shown in Figure 30-11.

      "The NA message acts like an IPv4 ARP Reply, listing that host’s MAC address.  The process of sending the NS and NA messages follows the same general process as RS and RA: The NS message asks for information, and the NA supplies the information.  The most obvious difference is that while RS/RA focuses on information held by routers, NS/NA focuses on information that could be held by any IPv6 host.  Neighbor Solicitation (NS): This message asks a host with a particular IPv6 address (the target address) to send back an NA with its MAC address listed.  The NS message is sent to the solicited-node multicast address associated with the target address, so the message is processed only by hosts whose last six hex digits match the address that is being queried.  Neighbor Advertisement (NA): This message lists the sender’s address as the target address, along with the matching MAC address.  It is sent back to the unicast address of the host that sent the original NS message.  In some cases, a host sends an unsolicited NA, in which case the message is sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address FF02::1.  NOTE With NDP, the word neighbor refers to the fact that the devices will be on the same data link; for example, the same VLAN.  Figure 31-4 shows an example of how a host (PC1) uses an NS message to learn the MAC address used by another host.  The NDP NS and NA messages replace the IPv4 ARP protocol in that it lets hosts discover the link-layer address of other IPv6 hosts on the same data link.  (IPv6 refers to hosts on the same data link as simply on-link.)  The NS message lists a target IPv6 unicast address, with the implied question: “What is your link address?” The NA message, in this example sent back to the original host that asked the question, lists that link address.

      "Discovering Addressing Info for SLAAC with NDP RS and RA The NDP RS and RA messages give hosts a means to ask routers to supply information; they also give routers a means to supply that information to hosts.  In short, RS/RA can act as a basic query/response protocol (or solicitation/advertisement, if you prefer the words from the RS and RA acronyms).  What could an IPv6 router know that an IPv6 host might want to learn?  Figure 31-2 shows one fact learned through the RS and RA messages—namely, the IPv6 address of the IPv6 router.  Another useful fact is the prefix and prefix length used on the local link.  Routers know the prefix and prefix length because of the typical ipv6 address command on each interface; that command lists the prefix length and enough information for the router to calculate the associated IPv6 prefix.  A host can learn these details using the RS and RA message exchange, as shown in Figure 31-3.

The later section “Using Stateless Address Auto Configuration” discusses the entire process.  Discovering Neighbor Link Addresses with NDP NS and NA NDP defines a second pair of matched solicitation and advertisement messages: the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages.

      "However, because the default router must be locally reachable, the default router setting typically refers to the router’s link-local address.  Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) defines several different functions related to IPv6 addressing, as follows: SLAAC: When using Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), the host uses NDP messages to learn the first part of its address, plus the prefix length.  Router Discovery: Hosts learn the IPv6 addresses of the available IPv6 routers in the same subnet using N DP messages.  Duplicate Address Detection: No matter how a host sets or learns its IPv6 address, the host waits to use the address until the host knows that no other host uses the same address.  How does a host detect this problem?  Using NDP messages, of course, through a process called Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).  Neighbor MAC Discovery: After a host has passed the DAD process and uses its IPv6 address, a LAN-based host will need to learn the MAC address of other hosts in the same subnet.  NDP replaces IPv4’s ARP, providing messages that replace the ARP Request and Reply messages.  The rest of this section steps through each of these four functions to varying degrees.  Note that this section defers most of the discussion of the SLAAC process until later in the chapter, focusing more on the core NDP functions in this section.  Discovering Routers with NDP RS and RA For IPv6, ICMPv6 replaces the ICMP protocol.  As with ICMP for IPv4, ICMPv6 includes a Request and Echo Reply message for use by the ping command.  ICMPv6 also includes all the NDP messages, like the two messages in this list.  These two messages enable routers to learn addressing and subnet information from any routers in the subnet.  Router Solicitation (RS): This message is sent to the “all-IPv6-routers” local-scope multicast address of FF02::2 so that the message asks all routers, on the local link only, to identify themselves. \n",

      "For example, the console runs at a speed of 9600 bps by default, but that console speed is based on the default settings of a couple of bits in the configuration register.  By changing specific bits in the configuration register, the next time the router boots, you can change the speed of the console line.  You can set the configuration register value with the config-register global configuration command.  Engineers set the configuration register to different values for many reasons, but the most common are to help tell the router what IOS image to load, as explained in the next few pages, and in the password recovery process.  For example, the global configuration command config-register 0x2100 sets the value to hexadecimal 2100, which causes the router to load the ROMMON OS rather than IOS the next time the router is reloaded.  Interestingly, Cisco routers automatically save the new configuration register value when you press Enter at the end of the config-register command; you do not need to use the copy running-config startup-config command after changing the configuration register.  However, the configuration register’s new value has no effect until the next time the router is reloaded.  NOTE On most Cisco routers, the default configuration register setting is hexadecimal 2102, which leaves the console speed at 9600 bps and tells the router to load an IOS image.  How a Router Chooses Which OS to Load A router chooses the OS to load based on two factors: ■ The last hex digit in the configuration register (called the boot field) ■ Any boot system global configuration commands in the startup-config file The boot field, the fourth hex digit in the configuration register, tells the router the initial instructions about what OS to try to load.  The router looks at the boot field’s value when the router is powered on or when reloaded.  The boot field’s value then tells the router how to proceed with choosing which OS to load.  NOTE Cisco represents hexadecimal values by preceding the hex digits with 0x; for example, 0xA would mean a single hex digit A. \n",

      "However, that default configuration is not enough to allow the user to see the log messages.  The user must also issue the terminal monitor EXEC command during the login session, which tells IOS that this terminal session would like to receive log messages.  Figure 33-1 summarizes these key points about how IOS on a Cisco router or switch processes log messages for currently connected users.  In the figure, user A sits at the console, and always receives log messages.

However, clearly, it would be useful to keep a copy of the log messages for later review, so IOS provides two primary means to keep a copy.  IOS can store copies of the log messages in RAM by virtue of the logging buffered global configuration command.  Then any user can come back later and see the old log messages by using the show logging EXEC command.  As a second option—an option used frequently in production networks—all devices store their log messages centrally to a syslog server.  RFC 5424 defines the Syslog protocol, which provides the means by which a device like a switch or router can use a UDP protocol to send messages to a syslog server for storage.  All devices can send their log messages to the server.  Later, a user can connect to the server (typically with a graphical user interface) and browse the log messages from various devices.  To configure a router or switch to send log messages to a syslog server, add the logging {address|hostname} global command, referencing the IP address or hostname of the syslog server.  Figure 33-2 shows the ideas behind the buffered logging and syslog logging. \n",

      "You can monitor CPU use with the show process cpu command, but you should use caution when using debug commands carefully on production devices.  Also, note the more CLI users that receive debug messages, the more CPU that is consumed.  So, some installations choose to not include debug-level log messages for console and terminal logging, requiring users to look at the logging buffer or syslog for those messages, just to reduce router CPU load.  Network Time Protocol (NTP) Each networking device has some concept of a date and a time-of-day clock.  For instance, the log messages discussed in the first major section of this chapter had a timestamp with the date and time of day listed.  Now imagine looking at all the log messages from all routers and switches stored at a syslog server.  All those messages have a date and timestamp, but how do we make sure the timestamps are consistent?  How do we make sure that all devices synchronize their time-of-day clocks so that you can make sense of all the log messages at the syslog server?  How could you make sense of the messages for an event that impacted devices in three different time zones?  For example, consider the messages on two routers, R1 and R2, as shown in Example 33-6.  Routers R1 and R2 do not synchronize their clocks.  A problem keeps happening on the serial link between the two routers.

The two top levels in the figure are the most severe.  Messages from this level mean a serious and immediate issue exists.  The next three levels, called Critical, Error, and Warning, also tell about events that impact the device, but they are not as immediate and severe.  For instance, one common log message about an interface failing to a physically down state shows as a severity level 3 message.  Continuing down the figure, IOS uses the next two levels (5 and 6) for messages that are more about notifying the user rather than errors.  Finally, the last level in the figure is used for messages requested by the debug command, as shown in an example later in this chapter.  Table 33-2 summarizes the configuration commands used to enable logging and to set the severity level for each type.  When the severity level is set, IOS will send that service messages of that severity level and more severe.  For example, the command logging console 4 causes IOS to send severity level 0–4 messages to the console.  Also, note that the command to disable each service is the no version of the command, with no in front of the command ( no logging console, no logging monitor, and so on). \n",

Analyzing Topology Using CDP and LLDP The first two major sections of this chapter showed two features—Syslog and NTP—that work the same way on both routers and switches.  This final section shows yet another feature common to both routers and switches, with two similar protocols: the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) and the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP).  This section focuses on CDP, followed by LLDP.  Examining Information Learned by CDP CDP discovers basic information about neighboring routers and switches without needing to know the passwords for the neighboring devices.  To discover information, routers and switches send CDP messages out each of their interfaces.  The messages essentially announce information about the device that sent the CDP message.  Devices that support CDP learn information about others by listening for the advertisements sent by other devices.  CDP discovers several useful details from the neighboring Cisco devices: Device identifier: Typically the host name Address list: Network and data link addresses Port identifier: The interface on the remote router or switch on the other end of the link that sent the CDP advertisement Capabilities list: Information on what type of device it is (for example, a router or a switch) Platform: The model and OS level running on the device CDP plays two general roles: to provide information to the devices to support some function and to provide information to the network engineers that manage the devices. \n",

      "While the IOS for each type of device has some differences, just because routers and switches perform different functions, IOS that runs on these switches and routers has many similarities.  Within the exams, Cisco attempts to be generic in that the exam does not ask you to make distinctions between different models of routers and switches.  This chapter looks at some topics that again apply to IOS that runs in both Cisco routers and Cisco Catalyst switches.  In particular, this chapter looks at the IOS itself: the file systems where the IOS stores files, how to upgrade IOS, and what happens when you reboot the router or switch to upgrade the IOS.  This chapter also looks at how to manage configuration files beyond simply keeping them inside router or switch memory in the startupconfig file.  This chapter also includes a brief discussion about how to recover if you lose the password for a router or switch.  Note that this chapter focuses on features on Cisco routers.  However, many of the same features work either exactly the same, or in a very similar way, on Cisco Catalyst switches.  Managing Cisco IOS Images and Upgrades IOS exists as a file—a single file—that the router then loads into RAM to use as its operating system (OS).  This first major section of the chapter works through the story of how to upgrade to a new version of IOS.  This first section has one primary purpose but many secondary purposes.  Primarily, this section shows how to upgrade IOS on a router.  As a secondary goal, this section works through a variety of small IOS features that engineers use during that upgrade process—features not covered in any detail until this point in the book.  This section explains these topics, in order: 1.  The IOS File System 2.  Upgrading IOS Images 3.  The Cisco IOS Boot Sequence The IOS File System Every OS creates file systems to store files.  A computer needs some type of permanent storage, but it needs more than just a place to store bytes.  The OS organizes the storage into a file system, which includes directories, structure, and filenames, with the associated rules. \n",

Now look down to the bottom, to this same command on R2.  R2 lists 172.16.3.3, which is R3, because of R2’s ntp server 172.16.3.3 command.  The command in the middle, show ntp status, on R1, lists many NTP-specific details.  Of particular note is the first line that states whether it has synchronized with some other NTP server.  In this case, R1 has synchronized.  Any router acting as an NTP client will list “unsynchronized” in that first line until the NTP synchronization process completes with at least one server.  Note that a router acting solely as an NTP server (like R3), and not attempting to synchronize its time, will always show “unsynchronized” in that first line of command output.  NTP Using a Loopback Interface for Better Availability An NTP server will accept NTP messages arriving to any of its IPv4 addresses by default.  However, the clients reference a specific IP address on the NTP server.  That creates an availability issue.  For instance, consider the topology in Figure 33-6, with Router R4 on the right acting as NTP server and the other routers acting as clients.  R4 has three IP addresses that the clients could put in their ntp server address commands.  Now consider what happens when one interface on R4 fails, but only one.  No matter which of the three interfaces fails, that IP address on that interface cannot be used to send and receive packets.  In that case, for any NTP clients that had referred to that specific IP address  792  ■ There would likely still be a route to reach R4 itself.  ■ The NTP client would not be able to send packets to the configured address because that interface is down. \n",

      "In fact, you can take the encrypted password from this example, plug it into one of these sites, and it decrypts to “cisco.” So, the service password-encryption command will slow down the curious, but it will not stop a knowledgeable attacker.  Encoding the Enable Passwords with Hashes In the earliest days of IOS, Cisco used the enable password password global command to define the password that users had to use to reach enable mode (after using the enable EXEC command).  However, as just noted, the enable password password command stored the password as clear text, or was encrypted in a way that was easily decrypted.  Cisco solved the problem of only weak ways to store the password of the enable password password global command by making a more secure replacement: the enable secret password global command.  However, both these commands exist in IOS even today.  The next few pages look at these two commands from a couple of angles, including interactions between these two commands, why the enable secret command is more secure, along with a note about some advancements in how IOS secures the enable secret password .  Interactions Between Enable Password and Enable Secret First, for real life: use the enable secret password global command, and ignore the enable password password global command.  That has been true for around 20 years.  However, to be complete, Cisco has never removed the much weaker enable password command from IOS.  So, on a single switch (or router), you can configure one or the other, both, or neither.  What then does the switch expect us to type as the password to reach enable mode?  It boils down to these rules: Both commands configured: Users must use the password in the enable secret password command (and ignore the enable password password command).  Only one command configured: Use the password in that one command.  Neither command configured (default): Console users move directly to enable mode without a password prompt; Telnet and SSH users are rejected with no option to supply an enable password.  807 34 Making the Enable Secret Truly Secret with a Hash Cisco’s enable secret command protects the password value by never even storing the cleartext password in the configuration. \n",

      "  -----------------------------------\n",
      "Knowing that fact, the switch can make a comparison when a user types a password after using the enable EXEC command as follows: Step 1.  IOS computes the MD5 hash of the password in the enable secret command and stores the hash of the password in the configuration.  Step 2.  When the user types the enable command to reach enable mode, a password that needs to be checked against that configuration command, IOS hashes the clear-text password as typed by the user.  Step 3.  IOS compares the two hashed values: If they are the same, the user-typed password must be the same as the configured password.  808  As a result, IOS can store the hash of the password but never store the clear-text password; however, it can still determine whether the user typed the same password.  Switches and routers already use the logic described here, but you can see the evidence by looking at the switch configuration.  Example 34-2 shows the creation of the enable secret command, with a few related details.  This example shows the stored (hashed) value as revealed in the show running-configuration command output.  That output also shows that IOS changed the enable secret fred command to list the encryption type 5 (which means the listed password is actually an MD5 hash of the clear-text password).  The gobbledygook long text string is the hash, preventing others from reading the password.  Example 34-2 Cisco IOS Encoding Password “cisco” as Type 5 (MD5) Switch3(config)# enable secret fred Switch3(config)# ^Z Switch3# show running-config | include enable secret enable secret 5 $1$ZGMA$e8cmvkz4UjiJhVp7.maLE1 Switch3# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line.

      "However, that one sentence may cause you a bit of confusion: If the router or switch does not remember the clear-text password, how can the switch know that the user typed the right password after using the enable command?  This section works through a few basics to show you how and appreciate why the password’s value is secret.  First, by default, IOS uses a hash function called Message Digest 5 (MD5) to store an alternative value in the configuration, rather than the clear-text password.  Think of MD5 as a rather complex mathematical formula.  In addition, this formula is chosen so that even if you know the exact result of the formula—that is, the result after feeding the clear-text password through the formula as input—it is computationally difficult to compute the original clear-text password.  Figure 34-3 shows the main ideas : Clear Text Secret MD5 Hash: F(Clear Text) = Secret )·�6HFUHW�� �&OHDU7H[W Computationally Difficult!  S tSecretSecretSecretSecretSec eComputationally Simple!  Figure 34-3 One-Way Nature of MD5 Hash to Create Secret NOTE “Computationally difficult” is almost a code phrase, meaning that the designers of the function hope that no one is willing to take the time to compute the original clear text.  So, if the original clear-text password cannot be re-created, how can a switch or router use it to compare to the clear-text password typed by the user?  The answer depends on another fact about these security hashes like MD5: Each clear-text input results in a unique result from the math formula.  The enable secret fred command generates an MD5 hash.  If a user types “fred” when trying to enter enable mode, IOS will run MD5 against that value and get the same MD5 hash as is listed in the enable secret command, so IOS allows the user to access enable mode.  If the user typed any other value besides “fred”, IOS would compute a different MD5 hash than the value stored with the enable secret command, and IOS would reject that user’s attempt to reach enable mode. \n",

      "ROMMON contains a small and different set of CLI commands as compared to IOS, with the commands varying from router model to router model.  However, each router’s ROMMON software supports some command, usually the confreg command, that lets you set the configuration register.  For instance, the ROMMON command confreg 0x2142 would set the correct bit to tell the router to ignore the startup-config file at reload.  So, how do you get the router to boot in ROMMON mode?  Older routers require you to press the break key at the console during boot of the router.  Some newer routers happen to have all removable flash memory—on those, just remove the flash (so there is no IOS available), and turn the router off and back on, and the router has no IOS to load—so it loads ROMMON.  (Put the flash back in once ROMMON loads .)  In summary, the big ideas behind password recovery are as follows: Step 1.  Boot ROMMON, either by breaking into the boot process from the console or by first removing all the flash memory.  Step 2.  Set the configuration register to ignore the startup-config file (for example, confreg 0x2142).  Step 3.  Boot the router with an IOS.  The router boots with no configuration.

Typically, Cisco routers have their IOS in one of the local physical file systems, most often in permanent flash.  The only requirement is that the IOS be in some reachable file system—even if the file sits on an external server and the device loads the OS over the network.  However, the best practice is to store each device’s IOS file in flash that will remain with the device permanently.  Figure 35-1 illustrates the process to upgrade an IOS image into flash memory, using the following steps: Step 1.  Obtain the IOS image from Cisco, usually by downloading the IOS image from cisco.com using HTTP or FTP.  Step 2.  Place the IOS image someplace that the router can reach.  Locations include TFTP or FTP servers in the network or a USB flash drive that is then inserted into the router.  825 35 Step 3.

      "The router copies a bootstrap program from ROM into RAM and runs the bootstrap program.  Step 3.  The bootstrap program decides which IOS image (or the ROMMON OS) to load into RAM, and then the bootstrap program loads the OS.  After loading the chosen OS image, the bootstrap program hands over control of the router hardware to the newly loaded OS.  Step 4.  If the bootstrap program happened to load IOS, once IOS is running, it finds the startup-config file and loads it into RAM as the running-config.  All routers attempt all four steps each time the router is powered on or reloaded.  The first two steps do not have any options to choose; either both of these steps succeed or the initialization fails.  If it fails, you might need to call the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for support.  However, Steps 3 and 4 have several configurable options that tell the router what to do next, as noted in Figure 35-3.  NVRAM Network Or Flash Network Console Or Or IOS RAM Running Config Step 3 Step 4 Figure 35-3 Loading IOS and Initial Configuration   831 35 As you can see, the router has options at both Steps 3 and 4 in the figure.  However, at Step 4, routers almost always load the configuration from NVRAM (the startup-config file), when it exists.  There is no real advantage to storing the initial configuration anywhere else except NVRAM, so this chapter does not look further into the options of Step 4.  But there are reasonable motivations for keeping IOS images in flash and on servers in the network, so the rest of this section examines Step 3 in more detail.  The Configuration Register A router’s configuration register has an impact on a router’s choice of which OS to load.  Routers use a configuration register to find some configuration settings at boot time, before the router has loaded IOS and read the startup-config file.  The 16 bits (4 hex digits) in the configuration register set a variety of different parameters. \n",

      "The router will now go through the boot sequence discussed in this section, load the new IOS image, and the IOS upgrade is complete.  For instance, Example 35-2 showed a router copying an IOS image into flash; that router would then also need a boot system flash:c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.152-4.M1.bin command saved into the startup-config.  Verifying the IOS Image Using the show version Command Once it is upgraded, you should verify the new IOS has loaded using the show version command.  This command lists not only the version of software but also the source from which  834  the router found the IOS image and the time since it loaded the IOS.  As a result, the show version command actually identifies some key facts about the results of the previous boot process.  The show version command lists many other facts as well, as shown in Example 35-7.  The example shows output from Router R2, which has been configured with the boot system flash:c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.152-4.M1.bin command and been reloaded, migrating to use the new Version 15.2(4) IOS.  To help point out some of the many important facts in this command, the example shows many highlighted items.  The following list describes each of the items in the output in the same order as they are shown in the example, top to bottom: 1.  The IOS version 2.  The uptime (the length of time that has passed since the last reload) 3.  The reason for the last reload of IOS ( reload command, power off/on, software failure) 4.  The time of the last loading of IOS (if the router’s clock has been set) 5.  The source from which the router loaded the current IOS 6.  The amount of RAM memory 7.

      "For example, the console runs at a speed of 9600 bps by default, but that console speed is based on the default settings of a couple of bits in the configuration register.  By changing specific bits in the configuration register, the next time the router boots, you can change the speed of the console line.  You can set the configuration register value with the config-register global configuration command.  Engineers set the configuration register to different values for many reasons, but the most common are to help tell the router what IOS image to load, as explained in the next few pages, and in the password recovery process.  For example, the global configuration command config-register 0x2100 sets the value to hexadecimal 2100, which causes the router to load the ROMMON OS rather than IOS the next time the router is reloaded.  Interestingly, Cisco routers automatically save the new configuration register value when you press Enter at the end of the config-register command; you do not need to use the copy running-config startup-config command after changing the configuration register.  However, the configuration register’s new value has no effect until the next time the router is reloaded.  NOTE On most Cisco routers, the default configuration register setting is hexadecimal 2102, which leaves the console speed at 9600 bps and tells the router to load an IOS image.  How a Router Chooses Which OS to Load A router chooses the OS to load based on two factors: ■ The last hex digit in the configuration register (called the boot field) ■ Any boot system global configuration commands in the startup-config file The boot field, the fourth hex digit in the configuration register, tells the router the initial instructions about what OS to try to load.  The router looks at the boot field’s value when the router is powered on or when reloaded.  The boot field’s value then tells the router how to proceed with choosing which OS to load.  NOTE Cisco represents hexadecimal values by preceding the hex digits with 0x; for example, 0xA would mean a single hex digit A. \n",

The General Ideas Behind Cisco Password Recovery/Reset Although the details differ from model to model, all the password recovery procedures follow the same general principles.  First, the end goal of the process is to make the router boot IOS while ignoring the startup-config file.  Of course, this startup configuration holds all the passwords.  Once the router boots while ignoring the initial configuration, the router has no passwords at all, so you can log in at the console with no password restrictions and reconfigure all the passwords.  One config-register bit holds the key: the ignore configuration bit.  (The bit is the second bit in the third nibble, reading left to right.)  When set to binary 1, the router will ignore the startup-config file the next time the router is loaded.  To set that value, the default configuration register value of 0x2102 can be changed to 0x2142.  Unfortunately, under normal circumstances, you need to remember the enable password to reach the mode to configure the configuration register’s value.  When you need to do password recovery, you clearly do not know the passwords, so how can you change the configuration register?  The solution is to use ROMMON mode.  ROMMON enables you to set the configuration register. \n",

      "Conversely, the speed command is an interface subcommand that applies to each switch interface that can run at different speeds, so it is a subcommand, applying to the particular interface under which it is configured.  Storing Switch Configuration Files When you configure a switch, it needs to use the configuration.  It also needs to be able to retain the configuration in case the switch loses power.  Cisco switches contain random-access memory (RAM) to store data while Cisco IOS is using it, but RAM loses its contents when the switch loses power or is reloaded.  To store information that must be retained when the switch loses power or is reloaded, Cisco switches use several types of more permanent memory, none of which has any moving parts.  By avoiding components with moving parts (such as traditional disk drives), switches can maintain better uptime and availability.  The following list details the four main types of memory found in Cisco switches, as well as the most common use of each type: ■ RAM: Sometimes called DRAM, for dynamic random-access memory, RAM is used by the switch just as it is used by any other computer: for working storage.  The running (active) configuration file is stored here.  ■ Flash memory: Either a chip inside the switch or a removable memory card, flash memory stores fully functional Cisco IOS images and is the default location where the switch gets its Cisco IOS at boot time.  Flash memory also can be used to store any other files, including backup copies of configuration files.  ■ ROM: Read-only memory (ROM) stores a bootstrap (or boothelper) program that is loaded when the switch first powers on.  This bootstrap program then finds the full Cisco IOS image and manages the process of loading Cisco IOS into RAM, at which point Cisco IOS takes over operation of the switch.  ■ NVRAM: Nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) stores the initial or startup configuration file that is used when the switch is first powered on and when the switch is reloaded.  Figure 6-9 summarizes this same information in a briefer and more convenient form for memorization and study. \n",

The copy startup-config running-config command makes up for the fact that the router ignored the startup-config file when it booted IOS.  Also, to be ready for the next time the router reloads, put the configuration register value back to its normal permanent value, usually hex 2102.  NOTE When using this process, at the end, take the time to check the interface state of the router interfaces.

This chapter focuses on the most commonly used methods for the Cisco installed base of products at the time that Cisco released the current exams.  This license method is often called PAK licensing because the licensing process uses a value called a product authorization key (PAK) .  This chapter also briefly introduces the earlier licensing methods and the new emerging licensing method that will replace PAK licensing over time, just for perspective.  This chapter also guides you through the process of verifying your current licensing on a router, installing a new license, activating a license code, and backing up and uninstalling licensing from a device.  IOS Packaging Cisco builds the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) software as a single file.  Using a single file makes installation of a new IOS simple: You download the one file from Cisco, copy it to flash memory on the router, and then take steps to make sure the router boots the next time using the new IOS image.  Cisco continues to build the IOS as a single file today but has changed what it includes in the IOS image files.  This section looks at both the old and new methodologies for constructing images.  This chapter also covers the new IOS licensing features that enable a router to use different parts of the IOS. \n",

      "While the IOS for each type of device has some differences, just because routers and switches perform different functions, IOS that runs on these switches and routers has many similarities.  Within the exams, Cisco attempts to be generic in that the exam does not ask you to make distinctions between different models of routers and switches.  This chapter looks at some topics that again apply to IOS that runs in both Cisco routers and Cisco Catalyst switches.  In particular, this chapter looks at the IOS itself: the file systems where the IOS stores files, how to upgrade IOS, and what happens when you reboot the router or switch to upgrade the IOS.  This chapter also looks at how to manage configuration files beyond simply keeping them inside router or switch memory in the startupconfig file.  This chapter also includes a brief discussion about how to recover if you lose the password for a router or switch.  Note that this chapter focuses on features on Cisco routers.  However, many of the same features work either exactly the same, or in a very similar way, on Cisco Catalyst switches.  Managing Cisco IOS Images and Upgrades IOS exists as a file—a single file—that the router then loads into RAM to use as its operating system (OS).  This first major section of the chapter works through the story of how to upgrade to a new version of IOS.  This first section has one primary purpose but many secondary purposes.  Primarily, this section shows how to upgrade IOS on a router.  As a secondary goal, this section works through a variety of small IOS features that engineers use during that upgrade process—features not covered in any detail until this point in the book.  This section explains these topics, in order: 1.  The IOS File System 2.  Upgrading IOS Images 3.  The Cisco IOS Boot Sequence The IOS File System Every OS creates file systems to store files.  A computer needs some type of permanent storage, but it needs more than just a place to store bytes.  The OS organizes the storage into a file system, which includes directories, structure, and filenames, with the associated rules. \n",

      "The real world uses paper receipts to show that you bought something at a store; for software feature sets, the receipt is called a product authorization key, or PAK.  The PAK acts as a receipt; plus, it has another unique number on it, which Cisco can find in a database to confirm what feature set license you actually bought.  The next step connects the license, which you can use on any router of that same model, to a specific router.  To do so, you walk through a process that marries the PAK (the generic rights to a license) to the UDI (that identifies a specific router) to create a license key.  To do http://www.cisco.com/go/license  856  so, you open a web browser and copy the PAK and UDI numbers onto a web page at the Cisco Product License Registration Portal.  Cisco checks out the details: that the UDI is for a real router, that the PAK is real, that you have not already used that one PAK to enable this feature on another router, and any other checks to prevent fraud.

This chapter focuses on the most commonly used methods for the Cisco installed base of products at the time that Cisco released the current exams.  This license method is often called PAK licensing because the licensing process uses a value called a product authorization key (PAK) .  This chapter also briefly introduces the earlier licensing methods and the new emerging licensing method that will replace PAK licensing over time, just for perspective.  This chapter also guides you through the process of verifying your current licensing on a router, installing a new license, activating a license code, and backing up and uninstalling licensing from a device.  IOS Packaging Cisco builds the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) software as a single file.  Using a single file makes installation of a new IOS simple: You download the one file from Cisco, copy it to flash memory on the router, and then take steps to make sure the router boots the next time using the new IOS image.  Cisco continues to build the IOS as a single file today but has changed what it includes in the IOS image files.  This section looks at both the old and new methodologies for constructing images.  This chapter also covers the new IOS licensing features that enable a router to use different parts of the IOS. \n",

      "For example: ■ show running-config command: Refers to file system:running-config ■ show startup-config command: Refers to file nvram:startup-config ■ show flash command: Refers to default flash IFS (usually flash0:) Upgrading IOS Images One of the first steps to upgrade a router’s IOS to a new version is to obtain the new IOS image and put it in the right location.  Typically, Cisco routers have their IOS in one of the local physical file systems, most often in permanent flash.  The only requirement is that the IOS be in some reachable file system—even if the file sits on an external server and the device loads the OS over the network.  However, the best practice is to store each device’s IOS file in flash that will remain with the device permanently.  Figure 35-1 illustrates the process to upgrade an IOS image into flash memory, using the following steps: Step 1.  Obtain the IOS image from Cisco, usually by downloading the IOS image from cisco.com using HTTP or FTP.  Step 2.  Place the IOS image someplace that the router can reach.  Locations include TFTP or FTP servers in the network or a USB flash drive that is then inserted into the router.  825 35 Step 3.  Issue the copy command from the router, copying the file into the flash memory that usually remains with the router on a permanent basis.

      "Cisco Product License Registration Portal Router-specific License Key (File) 1 3 Feature Set Rights on a Router Model Series PAK 2UDI Router Model Unique Serial Number Figure 36-6 PAK and UDI Needed to Get Unique License Key File from Cisco.com NOTE As of the time of this writing, the landing page for the Cisco Product License Registration Portal (www.cisco.com/go/license) included videos about how to do the steps in Figure 36-6 plus the rest of the process of how to work with Cisco licenses.  The videos call the process in Steps 1 and 2 “fulfilling a PAK.” After the three steps shown in Figure 36-6, the router still does not have the feature set enabled.  At this point, the license key exists as a file after Step 3.  That license key unlocks that one feature set on one router: the router whose UDI was used to create the key.  The rest of the process enables the license on that one router, by moving the license key file into that one router and reloading the router.  The next step can use any supported method to make the license key file available to the router, with a couple of commands to follow.  In a lab, the simplest way is to just copy the file to a USB flash drive and move the flash drive to the router’s USB slot.  For remote routers, just copy the file to a known TFTP, FTP, or HTTP server.  The steps, picking up with Step 4 as a continuation of the previous list, are as follows: http://www.cisco.com/go/license http://www.cisco.com/go/license   857 36 Step 4.  Make the file available to the router via USB or some network server.  Step 5.  From the router CLI, issue the license install url command to install the license key file into the router.  (The URL points to the file.)  Step 6.  Reload the router to pick up the changes.  Figure 36-7 shows these next three steps. \n",
