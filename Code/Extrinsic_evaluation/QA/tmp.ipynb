Love you, precious girl. vi CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Acknowledgments Brett Bartow again served as executive editor on the book. We’ve worked together on probably 20+ titles now. Besides the usual wisdom and good decision making to guide the project, he was the driving force behind adding all the new apps to the DVD/web. As always, a pleasure to work with, and an important part of deciding what the entire Official Cert Guide series direction should be. As part of writing these books, we work in concert with Cisco. A special thanks goes out to various people on the Cisco team who work with Pearson to create Cisco Press books. In particular, Greg Cote, Joe Stralo, and Phil Vancil were a great help while we worked on these titles. Chris Cleveland did the development editing for the very first Cisco Press exam certi- fication guide way back in 1998, and he’s been involved with the series ever since. It’s always great to work with Chris, even though I’m jealous of his office setup. This book has more moving parts than most, and Chris’s part of the work happened on a challeng- ing timeline. Thanks, Chris, for the many late-night hours working through the different elements, and especially for keeping us on track with the new features. As for technical editors, ho hum, Elan Beer did his usual amazing job. It is truly abnormal to find one person who can do all aspects of technical editing in the same pass, with excellence. From finding small technical errors, to noticing phrasing that might mis- lead, to suggesting where an extra thought or two rounds out a topic, Elan does it all. Fantastic job as usual; thanks, Elan. Aubrey Adams tech edited the book, his first time tech editing one of my books, and he also provided some excellent feedback. Aubrey’s experience teaching the material was a big help in particular, because he knows of the common mistakes that students make when learning these same topics. Diligent, objective, useful comments all around; thanks, Aubrey! Welcome and thanks to a new team member, Lisa Matthews, new at least in terms of someone I interact with during the writing process. Lisa handled all the practice app development: taking various appendixes, learning some subnetting (fun, huh Lisa?), and building apps to make the practice experience more interactive. Thanks for guiding us through the process, Lisa! I love the magic wand that is production. Presto, word docs with gobs of queries and comments feed into the machine, and out pops these beautiful books. Thanks to Sandra Schroeder, Tonya Simpson, Mandie Frank, for jumping into the fray to keep the sched- ule moving, and all the production team for making the magic happen. From fixing all my grammar, crummy word choices, passive-voice sentences, and then pulling the design and layout together, they do it all; thanks for putting it all together and making it look easy. And Tonya, once again getting the “opportunity” to manage two books with many elements at the same timeline, once again, the juggling act continues, and done well. Thanks for managing the whole production process again. Mike Tanamachi, illustrator and mind reader, did a great job on the figures again. I use a different process with the figures than most authors, with Mike drawing new figures as soon as I outline a new section or chapter. It means more edits when I change my mind, vii and lots of mind reading of what Wendell really wanted versus what I drew poorly on my Wacom tablet. Mike came through again with some beautiful finished products. And a thanks goes out to Laura Robbins for working on helping make sure all the figures follow our color standards—standards she helped develop over several other editions of other books. I could not have made the timeline for this book without Chris Burns of Certskills Professional. Chris owns the mind map process now, owns big parts of the lab develop- ment process for the associated labs added to my blogs, does various tasks related to specific chapters, and then catches anything I need to toss over my shoulder so I can focus on the books. Chris, you are the man! Sean Wilkins played the largest role he’s played so far with one of my books. A long- time co-collaborator with Pearson’s CCNA Simulator, Sean did a lot of technology work behind the scenes. No way the books are out on time without Sean’s efforts; thanks for the great job, Sean! A special thanks you to you readers who write in with suggestions and possible errors, and especially those of you who post online at the Cisco Learning Network. Without question, the comments I receive directly and overhear by participating at CLN made this edition a better book. Thanks to my wonderful wife, Kris, who helps make this sometimes challenging work lifestyle a breeze. I love walking this journey with you, doll. Thanks to my daughter Hannah (see dedication). And thanks to Jesus Christ, Lord of everything in my life. viii CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Contents at a Glance Introduction xxxiv Your Study Plan 2 Part I: Networking Fundamentals

The Command Reference describes these conventions as follows: ■ Boldface indicates commands and keywords that are entered literally as shown. In actual configuration examples and output (not general command syntax), boldface indicates commands that are manually input by the user (such as a show command). ■ Italic indicates arguments for which you supply actual values. ■ Vertical bars (|) separate alternative, mutually exclusive elements. ■ Square brackets ([ ]) indicate an optional element. ■ Braces ({ }) indicate a required choice. ■ Braces within brackets ([{ }]) indicate a required choice within an optional element. Introduction About the Exams Congratulations! If you’re reading far enough to look at this book’s Introduction, you’ve probably already decided to go for your Cisco certification. If you want to succeed as a technical person in the networking industry at all, you need to know Cisco. Cisco has a ridiculously high market share in the router and switch marketplace, with more than 80 percent market share in some markets. In many geographies and markets around the world, networking equals Cisco. If you want to be taken seriously as a network engineer, Cisco certification makes perfect sense. The Exams to Achieve CCENT and CCNA R&S Cisco announced changes to the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching certifications, and the related 100-105 ICND1, 200-105 ICND2, and 200-125 CCNA exams, early in the year 2016. Most everyone new to Cisco certifications begins with either CCENT or CCNA Routing and Switching (CCNA R&S). However, the paths to certification are not quite obvi- ous at first. The CCENT certification requires a single step: pass the ICND1 exam. Simple enough. Cisco gives you two options to achieve CCNA R&S certification, as shown in Figure I-1: pass both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams, or just pass the CCNA exam. Both paths cover the same exam topics, but the two-exam path does so spread over two exams rather than one. You also pick up the CCENT certification by going through the two-exam path, but you do not when working through the single-exam option. 100-105 ICND1 200-105 ICND2 200-125 CCNA CCENT CCNA Routing and Switching (CCNA R&S) Figure I-1 Cisco Entry-Level Certifications and Exams Note that Cisco has begun referencing some exams with a version number on some of their web pages. If that form holds true, the exams in Figure I-1 will likely be called version 3 (or v3 for short). Historically, the 200-125 CCNA R&S exam is the seventh separate version of the exam (which warrants a different exam number), dating back to 1998. To make sure you reference the correct exam, when looking for information, using forums, and registering for the test, just make sure to use the correct exam number as shown in the figure. Types of Questions on the Exams The ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA exams all follow the same general format. At the test- ing center, you sit in a quiet room with a PC. Before the exam timer begins, you have a chance to do a few other tasks on the PC; for instance, you can take a sample quiz just to get accustomed to the PC and the testing engine. Anyone who has user-level skills in Introduction xxxv getting around a PC should have no problems with the testing environment. The question types are ■ Multiple-choice, single-answer ■ Multiple-choice, multiple-answer ■ Testlet (one scenario with multiple multi-choice questions) ■ Drag-and-drop ■ Simulated lab (sim) ■ Simlet Before taking the test, learn the exam user interface by using the Cisco Exam Tutorial. To find the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial, search for “exam tutorial” at www.cisco.com. This tool walks through each type of question Cisco may ask on the exam. Although the first four types of questions in the list should be somewhat familiar from other tests in school, the last two are more common to IT tests and Cisco exams in particu- lar. Both use a network simulator to ask questions, so that you control and use simulated Cisco devices. In particular: Sim questions: You see a network topology, a lab scenario, and can access the devices. Your job is to fix a problem with the configuration. Simlet questions: This style combines sim and testlet question formats. Like a sim ques- tion, you see a network topology, a lab scenario, and can access the devices. However, like a testlet, you also see multiple multiple-choice questions. Instead of changing/fixing the configuration, you answer questions about the current state of the network. These two question styles with the simulator give Cisco the ability to test your configura- tion skills with sim questions, and your verification and troubleshooting skills with simlet questions. What’s on the CCNA Exams—And What’s in the Book? Ever since I was in grade school, whenever the teacher announced that we were having a test soon, someone would always ask, “What’s on the test?” Even in college, people would try to get more information about what would be on the exams. At heart, the goal is to know what to study hard, what to study a little, and what to not study at all. You can find out more about what’s on the exam from two primary sources: this book and from the Cisco website. The Cisco Published Exam Topics First, Cisco tells the world the specific topics on each of their exams. Cisco wants the pub- lic to know both the variety of topics, and an idea about the kinds of knowledge and skills required for each topic, for every Cisco certification exam. Just go to www.cisco.com/go/ certifications, look for the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching pages, and navigate until you see the exam topics in Appendix R, “Exam Topic Cross Reference.” This PDF appendix lists two cross references: one with a list of the exam topics and the chapters that include something about each topic, as well as the reverse: a list of chapters, with the exam topics included in each chapter. http://www.cisco.com http://www.cisco.com/go/certifications http://www.cisco.com/go/certifications xxxvi CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Cisco does more than just list the topic (for example, IPv4 addressing), but they also list the depth to which you must master the topic. The primary exam topics each list one or more verbs that describe the skill level required. For example, consider the following exam topic, which describes one of the most important topics in both CCENT and CCNA R&S: Configure, verify, and troubleshoot IPv4 addressing and subnetting Note that this one exam topic has three verbs (configure, verify, and troubleshoot). So, you should be able to not only configure IPv4 addresses and subnets, but you should under- stand them well enough to verify that the configuration works, and to troubleshoot prob- lems when it is not working. And if to do that, you need to understand concepts, and you need to have other knowledge, those details are implied. The exam questions will attempt to assess whether you can configure, verify, and troubleshoot. Note that the list of exam topics provides a certain level of depth. For example, the ICND1 100-105 exam topic list has 41 primary exam topics (topics with verbs), plus additional sub- topics that further define that technology area. You should take the time to not only read the exam topics, but read the short material above the exam topics as listed at the Cisco web page for each certification and exam. Look for notices about the use of unscored items, and the fact that Cisco intends the exam topics to be a set of general guidelines for the exams. This Book: About the Exam Topics This book provides a complete study system for the Cisco published exam topics for the ICND1 100-105 exam. All the topics in this book either directly relate to some ICND1 exam topic or provide more basic background knowledge for some exam topic. The scope of the book is based on the exam topics. For those of you thinking more specifically about the CCNA R&S certification and the CCNA 200-125 single-exam path to CCNA, this book covers about one-half of the CCNA exam topics. The ICND1 book (and ICND1 100-105 exam topics) covers about half of the topics listed for the CCNA 200-125 exam, and the ICND2 book (and the ICND2 200-105 exam topics) cover the other half. In short, for content, CCNA = ICND1 + ICND2. Book Features This book, and the similar CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide, go beyond what you would find in a simple technology book. These books give you a study system designed to help you not only learn facts but also to develop the skills need to pass the exams. To do that, in the technology chapters of the book, about three-quarters of the chapter is about the technology, and about one-quarter is for the related study features. The “Foundation Topics” section of each chapter contains rich content to explain the topics on the exam and to show many examples. This section makes extensive use of figures, with lists and tables for comparisons. It also highlights the most important topics in each chapter as key topics, so you know what to master first in your study. Most of the book’s features tie in some way to the need to study beyond simply reading the “Foundation Topics” section of each chapter. The rest of this section works through these book features. And because the book organizes your study by chapter, and then by part (a part contains multiple chapters), and then a final review at the end of the book, this Introduction discusses the book features introduced by chapter, part, and for final review. Introduction xxxvii Chapter Features and How to Use Each Chapter Each chapter of this book is a self-contained short course about one small topic area, orga- nized for reading and study, as follows: “Do I Know This Already?” quizzes: Each chapter begins with a prechapter quiz. Foundation Topics: This is the heading for the core content section of the chapter. Chapter Review: This section includes a list of study tasks useful to help you remember concepts, connect ideas, and practice skills-based content in the chapter. Figure I-2 shows how each chapter uses these three key elements. You start with the DIKTA quiz. You can use the score to determine whether you already know a lot, or not so much, and determine how to approach reading the Foundation Topics (that is, the technology content in the chapter). When finished, use the chapter review tasks to start working on mastering your memory of the facts and skills with configuration, verification, and trouble- shooting. Take Quiz 1) In-Chapter, or... 2) Companion Website 3) DVD High Score (Skim) Foundation Topics Low Score (Read) Foundation Topics Foundation Topics Chapter ReviewDIKTA Quiz Figure I-2 Three Primary Tasks for a First Pass Through Each Chapter In addition to these three main chapter features, each “Chapter Review” section uses a vari- ety of other book features, including the following: ■ Review Key Topics: Inside the “Foundation Topics” section, the Key Topic icon appears next to the most important items, for the purpose of later review and mastery. While all content matters, some is, of course, more important to learn, or needs more review to master, so these items are noted as key topics. The chapter review lists the key topics in a table; scan the chapter for these items to review them. ■ Complete Tables from Memory: Instead of just rereading an important table of informa- tion, some tables have been marked as memory tables. These tables exist in the Memory Table app that is available on the DVD and from the companion website. The app shows the table with some content removed, and then reveals the completed table, so you can work on memorizing the content. ■ Key Terms You Should Know: You do not need to be able to write a formal definition of all terms from scratch. However, you do need to understand each term well enough to understand exam questions and answers. The chapter review lists the key terminology from the chapter. Make sure you have a good understanding of each term, and use the DVD Glossary to cross-check your own mental definitions. ■ Labs: Many exam topics use verbs list “configure,” “verify,” and “troubleshoot”; all these refer to skills you should practice at the user interface (CLI) of a router or switch. The chapter review refers you to these other tools. The Introduction’s upcoming section titled “About Building Hands-On Skills” discusses your options. xxxviii CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide ■ Command References: Some book chapters cover a large amount of router and switch commands. The chapter review includes reference tables for the command used in that chapter, along with an explanation. Use these tables for reference, but also use them for study—just cover one column of the table, and see how much you can remember and complete mentally. ■ Review DIKTA Questions: Although you have already seen the DIKTA questions from the chapters in a part, re-answering those questions can prove a useful way to review facts. The part review suggests that you repeat the DIKTA questions, but using the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test (PCPT) exam software that comes with the book, for extra practice in answering multiple choice questions on a computer. ■ Subnetting and Other Process Exercises: Many chapters in the ICND1 book ask you to perform various tasks that use math or use a particular process. The chapter review asks you to do additional practice problems as found in DVD-only PDF appendixes. Part Features and How to Use Part Review The book organizes the chapters into parts. Each part contains a number of related chapters. Figure I-3 lists the titles of the parts and the chapters in those parts (by chapter number). Ethernet LANs: Design, VLANs, and Troubleshooting (10-12) Implementing Basic Ethernet LANs (6-9) Network Device Management (33-36)IP Version 6 (28-32) IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting (13-16) Implementing IPv4 (17-20) IPv4 Design and Troubleshooting (21-24) IPv4 Services: ACLs and NAT (25-27) 2 9 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 Network Fundamentals (1-5) Figure I-3 The Book Parts (by Title), and Chapter Numbers in Each Part Each book part ends with a “Part Review” section that contains a list of activities for study and review, much like the “Chapter Review” section at the end of each chapter. However, because the part review takes place after completing a number of chapters, the part review includes some tasks meant to help pull the ideas together from this larger body of work. The following list explains the types of tasks added to part review beyond the types men- tioned for chapter review: ■ Answer Part Review Questions: The books comes with exam software and databases on questions. One database holds questions written specifically for part review. These ques- tions tend to connect multiple ideas together, to help you think about topics from mul- tiple chapters, and to build the skills needed for the more challenging analysis questions on the exams. ■ Mind Maps: Mind maps are graphical organizing tools that many people find useful when learning and processing how concepts fit together. The process of creating mind maps helps you build mental connections. The part review elements make use of mind maps in several ways: to connect concepts and the related configuration commands, to connect show commands and the related networking concepts, and even to connect ter- minology. (For more information about mind maps, see the section “About Mind Maps.”) Introduction xxxix ■ Labs: The “Part Review” section will direct you to the kinds of lab exercises you should do with your chosen lab product, labs that would be more appropriate for this stage of study and review. (Check out the section “About Building Hands-On Skills” for informa- tion about lab options.) In addition to these tasks, many “Part Review” sections have you perform other tasks with book features mentioned in the “Chapter Review” section: repeating DIKTA quiz questions, reviewing key topics, and doing more lab exercises. Final Review The “Final Review” chapter at the end of this book lists a series of preparation tasks that you can best use for your final preparation before taking the exam. The “Final Review” chapter focuses on a three-part approach to helping you pass: practicing your skills, prac- ticing answering exam questions, and uncovering your weak spots. To that end, the “Final Review” chapter uses the same familiar book features discussed for the chapter review and part review elements, along with a much larger set of practice questions. Other Features In addition to the features in each of the core chapters, this book, as a whole, has additional study resources, including the following: ■ DVD-based practice exam: The companion DVD contains the powerful Pearson IT Certification Practice Test (PCPT) exam engine. You can take simulated ICND1 exams with the DVD and activation code included in this book. (You can take simulated ICND2 and CCNA R&S exams with the DVD in the CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide.) ■ CCENT ICND1 100-105 Network Simulator Lite: This lite version of the best-selling CCNA Network Simulator from Pearson provides you with a means, right now, to expe- rience the Cisco command-line interface (CLI). No need to go buy real gear or buy a full simulator to start learning the CLI. Just install it from the DVD in the back of this book. ■ eBook: If you are interested in obtaining an eBook version of this title, we have included a special offer on a coupon card inserted in the DVD sleeve in the back of the book. This offer enables you to purchase the CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test at a 70 percent discount off the list price. In addition to three versions of the eBook, PDF (for reading on your computer), EPUB (for reading on your tablet, mobile device, or Nook or other eReader), and Mobi (the native Kindle version), you also receive additional practice test questions and enhanced practice test features. ■ Subnetting videos: The companion DVD contains a series of videos that show you how to calculate various facts about IP addressing and subnetting (in particular, using the shortcuts described in this book). ■ Subnetting practice: The companion DVD contains five appendixes (D–H) with a set of subnetting practice problems and answers. This is a great resource to practice building subnetting skills. You can also do these same practice problems with applications that you can access from the DVD or the companion web site. xl CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide ■ Other practice: The companion DVD contains four other appendixes (I–K) that each contain other practice problems related to a particular chapter from the book. Use these for more practice on the particulars with some of the math- and process-oriented activi- ties in the chapters. You can also do these same practice problems with applications that you can access from the DVD or the companion website. ■ Mentoring videos: The DVD included with this book includes four other instructional videos, about the following topics: switch basics, CLI navigation, router configuration, and VLANs. ■ Companion website: The website www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205804 posts up- to-the-minute materials that further clarify complex exam topics. Check this site regu- larly for new and updated postings written by the author that provide further insight into the more troublesome topics on the exam. ■ PearsonITCertification.com: The website www.pearsonitcertification.com is a great resource for all things IT-certification related. Check out the great CCNA articles, vid- eos, blogs, and other certification preparation tools from the industry’s best authors and trainers. ■ CCNA Simulator: If you are looking for more hands-on practice, you might want to consider purchasing the CCNA Network Simulator. You can purchase a copy of this software from Pearson at http://pearsonitcertification.com/networksimulator or other retail outlets. To help you with your studies, I have created a mapping guide that maps each of the labs in the simulator to the specific sections in these CCNA cert guides. You can get this mapping guide for free on the Extras tab of the companion website. ■ Author’s website and blogs: The author maintains a website that hosts tools and links useful when studying for CCENT and CCNA. The site lists information to help you build your own lab, study pages that correspond to each chapter of this book and the ICND1 book, and links to the author’s CCENT Skills blog and CCNA Skills blog. Start at www.certskills.com; look to blog.certskills.com for a page about the blogs in particu- lar, with links to the pages with the labs related to this book. A Big New Feature: Review Applications One of the single biggest additions to this edition of the book is the addition of study apps for many of the chapter review activities. In the past, all chapter review activities use the book chapter, or the chapter plus a DVD-only appendix. Readers tell us they find that con- tent useful, but the content is static. This book (and the CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide) are the first Cisco Press Cert Guides with extensive interactive applications. Basically, most every activity that can be done at chapter review can now be done with an application. The applications can be found both on the DVD that comes with the book and on the book’s companion website. The advantages of using these apps are as follows: ■ Easier to use: Instead of having to print out copies of the appendixes and do the work on paper, these new apps provide you with an easy to use, interactive experience that you can easily run over and over. ■ Convenient: When you have a spare 5–10 minutes, go to the book’s website, and review content from one of your recently finished chapters. http://www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205804 http://www.pearsonitcertification.com http://pearsonitcertification.com/networksimulator http://www.certskills.com Introduction xli ■ Untethered from Book/DVD: Because these apps are available on the book’s companion web page in addition to the DVD, you can access your review activities from anywhere—no need to have the book or DVD with you. ■ Good for tactile learners: Sometimes looking at a static page after reading a chapter lets your mind wander. Tactile learners may do better by at least typing answers into an app, or clicking inside an app to navigate, to help keep you focused on the activity. Our in-depth reader surveys show that readers who use the chapter review tools like them, but that not everyone uses the “Chapter Review” sections consistently. So, we want to increase the number of people using the review tools, and make them both more useful and more interesting. Table I-1 summarizes these new applications and the traditional book fea- tures that cover the same content. Table I-1 Book Features with Both Traditional and App Options Feature Traditional App Key Topic Table with list; flip pages to find Key Topics Table app Config Checklist Just one of many types of key topics Config Checklist app Memory Table Two static PDF appendixes (one with sparse tables for you to complete, one with completed tables) Memory Table app Key Terms Listed in each “Chapter Review” section, with the Glossary in the back of the book Glossary Flash Cards app Subnetting Practice Appendixes D–H, with practice problems and answers A variety of apps, one per problem type Other Practice Appendixes I–K with practice problems and answers A variety of apps, one per problem type How to Get the Electronic Elements of This Book Traditionally, all chapter review activities use the book chapter plus appendixes, with the appendixes often being located on the DVD. But most of that content is static: useful, but static. If you buy the print book, and have a DVD drive, you have all the content on the DVD. Just spin the DVD and use the disk menu that should automatically start to explore all content. If you buy the print book but do not have a DVD drive, you can get the DVD files by reg- istering your book on the Cisco Press website. To do so, simply go to www.ciscopress.com/ register and enter the ISBN of the print book: 9781587205804. After you have registered your book, go to your account page and click the Registered Products tab. From there, click the Access Bonus Content link to get access to the book’s companion website. If you buy the Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test from Cisco Press, your book will automatically be registered on your account page. Simply go to your account page, click the Registered Products tab, and select Access Bonus Content to access the book’s companion website. http://www.ciscopress.com/register http://www.ciscopress.com/register xlii CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide If you buy the eBook from some other bookseller, the very last page of your eBook file will contain instructions for how to register the book and access the companion website. The steps are the same as noted earlier for those who buy the print book but do not have a DVD drive. Book Organization, Chapters, and Appendixes This book contains 36 core chapters, Chapters 1 through 36, with Chapter 37 as the “Final Review” chapter. Each core chapter covers a subset of the topics on the ICND1 exam. The core chapters are organized into sections. The core chapters cover the following topics: ■ Part I: Networking Fundamentals ■ Chapter 1, “Introduction to TCP/IP Networking,” introduces the central ideas and terms used by TCP/IP, and contrasts the TCP/IP networking model with the OSI model. ■ Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” introduces the concepts and terms used when building Ethernet LANs. ■ Chapter 3, “Fundamentals of WANs,” covers the concepts and terms used for the data link layer for WANs, including HDLC. ■ Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing”: IP is the main network layer protocol for TCP/IP. This chapter introduces the basics of IPv4, including IPv4 addressing and routing. ■ Chapter 5, “Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications”: This chapter completes most of the detailed discussion of the upper two layers of the TCP/IP model (transport and application), focusing on TCP and applications. ■ Part II: Implementing Basic Ethernet LANs ■ Chapter 6, “Using the Command-Line Interface,” explains how to access the text- based user interface of Cisco Catalyst LAN switches. ■ Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching,” shows how to use the Cisco CLI to verify the current status of an Ethernet LAN and how it switches Ethernet frames. ■ Chapter 8, “Confi guring Basic Switch Management,” explains how to confi gure Cisco switches for basic management features, such as remote access using Telnet and SSH. ■ Chapter 9, “Confi guring Switch Interfaces,” shows how to confi gure a variety of switch features that apply to interfaces, including duplex/speed and port security. ■ Part III: Ethernet LANs: Design, VLANs, and Troubleshooting ■ Chapter 10, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs,” examines various ways to design Ethernet LANs, discussing the pros and cons, and explains common design terminology. ■ Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs”: This chapter explains the concepts and confi guration surrounding virtual LANs, including VLAN trunking. ■ Chapter 12, “Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs,” focuses on how to tell whether the switch is doing what it is supposed to be doing, mainly through the use of show commands. Introduction xliii ■ Part IV: IP Version 4 Addressing and Subnetting ■ Chapter 13, “Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting,” walks you through the entire concept of subnetting, from starting with a Class A, B, or C network to a completed subnetting design as implemented in an enterprise IPv4 network. ■ Chapter 14, “Analyzing Classful IPv4 Networks”: IPv4 addresses originally fell into several classes, with unicast IP addresses being in Class A, B, and C. This chapter explores all things related to address classes and the IP network concept created by those classes. ■ Chapter 15, “Analyzing Subnet Masks,” shows how an engineer can analyze the key facts about a subnetting design based on the subnet mask. This chapter shows how to look at the mask and IP network to determine the size of each subnet and the number of subnets. ■ Chapter 16, “Analyzing Existing Subnets”: Most troubleshooting of IP connectivity problems starts with an IP address and mask. This chapter shows how to take those two facts and fi nd key facts about the IP subnet in which that host resides. ■ Part V: Implementing IPv4 ■ Chapter 17, “Operating Cisco Routers,” is like Chapter 8, focusing on basic device management, but it focuses on routers instead of switches. ■ Chapter 18, “Confi guring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes,” discusses how to add IPv4 address confi guration to router interfaces and how to confi gure static IPv4 routes. ■ Chapter 19, “Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2,” explains how routers work together to fi nd all the best routes to each subnet using a routing protocol. This chapter also shows how to confi gure the RIPv2 routing protocol for use with IPv4. ■ Chapter 20, “DHCP and IP Networking on Hosts,” discusses how hosts can be con- fi gured with their IPv4 settings, and how they can learn those settings with DHCP. ■ Part VI: IPv4 Design and Troubleshooting ■ Chapter 21, “Subnet Design,” takes a design approach to subnetting. This chapter begins with a classful IPv4 network, and asks why a particular mask might be chosen, and if chosen, what subnet IDs exist. ■ Chapter 22, “Variable-Length Subnet Masks,” moves away from the assumption of one subnet mask per network to multiple subnet masks per network—which makes subnetting math and processes much more challenging. This chapter explains those challenges. ■ Chapter 23, “IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools,” focuses on how to use two key trouble- shooting tools to fi nd routing problems: the ping and traceroute commands. ■ Chapter 24, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing,” looks at the most common IPv4 prob- lems and how to fi nd the root causes of those problems when troubleshooting. ■ Part VII: IPv4 Services: ACLs and NAT ■ Chapter 25, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists”: This chapter examines how standard IP ACLs can fi lter packets based on the source IP address so that a router will not forward the packet. xliv CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide ■ Chapter 26, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists”: This chapter examines both named and numbered ACLs, and both standard and extended IP ACLs. ■ Chapter 27, “Network Address Translation,” works through the complete concept, confi guration, verifi cation, and troubleshooting sequence for the router NAT feature, including how it helps conserve public IPv4 addresses. ■ Part VIII: IP Version 6 ■ Chapter 28, “Fundamentals of IP Version 6,” discusses the most basic concepts of IP version 6, focusing on the rules for writing and interpreting IPv6 addresses. ■ Chapter 29, “IPv6 Addressing and Subnetting,” works through the two branches of unicast IPv6 addresses—global unicast addresses and unique local addresses—that act somewhat like IPv4 public and private addresses, respectively. ■ Chapter 30, “Implementing IPv6 Addressing on Routers,” shows how to confi gure IPv6 routing and addresses on routers, while discussing a variety of special IPv6 addresses. ■ Chapter 31, “Implementing IPv6 Addressing on Hosts,” mirrors Chapter 20’s discus- sions of IPv4 on hosts, while adding details of how IPv6 uses Stateless Address Auto Confi guration (SLAAC). ■ Chapter 32, “Implementing IPv6 Routing,” shows how to add static routes to an IPv6 router’s routing table. ■ Part IX: Network Device Management ■ Chapter 33, “Device Management Protocols,” discusses the concepts and confi gura- tion of some common network management tools: syslog, NTP, CDP, and LLDP. ■ Chapter 34, “Device Security Features,” takes the discussion of device passwords a step deeper, and examines how to better secure devices through device hardening. ■ Chapter 35, “Managing IOS Files,” explains the IOS fi le system, focusing on key fi les like the IOS and confi guration fi les. The chapter shows how to upgrade IOS and to backup/restore the confi guration fi le. ■ Chapter 36, “IOS License Management,” discusses the Cisco per-device license man- agement practices through the use of PAK licensing. ■ Part X: Final Review ■ Chapter 37, “Final Review,” suggests a plan for fi nal preparation after you have fi n- ished the core parts of the book. ■ Part XI: Appendixes (In Print) ■ Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” lists several tables of numeric information, including a binary-to-decimal conversion table and a list of powers of 2. ■ Appendix B, “CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Exam Updates,” is a place for the au- thor to add book content mid-edition. Always check online for the latest PDF version of this appendix; the appendix lists download instructions. ■ The Glossary contains defi nitions for all the terms listed in the “Key Terms You Should Know” sections at the conclusion of Chapters 1 through 36. Introduction xlv ■ Part XII: DVD Appendixes The following appendixes are available in digital format on the DVD that accompanies this book: ■ Appendix C, “Answers to the ‘Do I Know This Already?’ Quizzes,” includes the explanations to all the questions from Chapters 1 through 36. ■ Appendix D, “Practice for Chapter 14: Analyzing Classful IPv4 Networks” ■ Appendix E, “Practice for Chapter 15: Analyzing Subnet Masks” ■ Appendix F, “Practice for Chapter 16: Analyzing Existing Subnets” ■ Appendix G, “Practice for Chapter 21: Subnet Design” ■ Appendix H, “Practice for Chapter 22: Variable-Length Subnet Masks” ■ Appendix I, “Practice for Chapter 25: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists” ■ Appendix J, “Practice for Chapter 28: Fundamentals of IP Version 6” ■ Appendix K, “Practice for Chapter 30: Implementing IPv6 Addressing on Routers” ■ Appendix L, “Mind Map Solutions,” shows an image of sample answers for all the part-ending mind map exercises. ■ Appendix M, “Study Planner,” is a spreadsheet with major study milestones, where you can track your progress through your study. ■ Appendix N, “Classless Inter-domain Routing,” is an extra chapter for anyone inter- ested in reading more about the concepts, terminology, and math related to CIDR. ■ Appendix O, “Route Summarization,” is a copy of a chapter that was in the previous edition of this book, but was removed for this edition. It is included here for anyone who has interest, and for instructors who may need the chapter for their existing course. ■ Appendix P, “Implementing Point-to-Point WANs,” is a copy of the ICND2 book’s chapter about serial WANs. In a lab environment, you may want to use serial WAN links, and you may not have a copy of the ICND2 book. I included this chapter for reference if you need a little more depth about serial links. ■ Appendix Q, “Topics from Previous Editions,” is a collection of information about topics that have appeared on previous versions of the CCNA exams. While no longer within this exam’s topics, the concepts are still of interest to someone with the CCENT or CCNA certifi cation. ■ Appendix R, “Exam Topics Cross Reference,” provides some tables to help you fi nd where each exam objectives is covered in the book. Reference Information This short section contains a few topics available for reference elsewhere in the book. You may read these when you first use the book, but you may also skip these topics and refer back to them later. In particular, make sure to note the final page of this introduction, which lists several contact details, including how to get in touch with Cisco Press. Install the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test Engine and Questions This book, like many other Cisco Press books, includes the rights to use the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test (PCPT) software, along with rights to use some exam ques- tions related to this book. PCPT allows has many options, including the option to answer xlvi CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide questions in study mode, so you can see the answers and explanations for each question as you go along, or to take a simulated exam that mimics real exam conditions, or to view questions in flash card mode, where all the answers are stripped out, challenging you to answer questions from memory. You should install PCPT so it is ready to use even for the earliest chapters. This book’s Part Review sections ask you specifically to use PCPT, and you can even take the DIKTA chap- ter pre-quizzes using PCPT. NOTE The right to use the exams associated with this book is based on an activation code. For those with a print book, the code is in the DVD sleeve at the back of the book. For those who purchase the Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test directly from the Cisco Press website, the code will be populated on your account page after purchase. For those who purchase a Kindle edition, the access code will be supplied directly from Amazon. Note that if you purchase an eBook version from any other source, the practice test is not included, as other vendors are not able to vend the required unique access code. Do not lose the activation code. NOTE Also on this same piece of paper, on the opposite side from the exam activation code, you will find a one-time-use coupon code that gives you 70 percent off the purchase of the CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide, Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test. PCPT Exam Databases with This Book This book includes an activation code that allows you to load a set of practice questions. The questions come in different exams or exam databases. When you install the PCPT soft- ware and type in the activation code, the PCPT software downloads the latest version of all these exam databases. And with the ICND1 book alone, you get four different “exams,” or four different sets of questions, as listed in Figure I-4. ICND1 Exam #1 ICND1 Exam #2 DIKTA (“Book”) Part Review Figure I-4 PCPT Exams/Exam Databases and When to Use Them You can choose to use any of these exam databases at any time, both in study mode and practice exam mode. However, many people find it best to save some of the exams until exam review time, after you have finished reading the entire book. Figure I-4 begins to sug- gest a plan, spelled out here: ■ During part review, use PCPT to review the DIKTA questions for that part, using study mode. ■ During part review, use the questions built specifically for part review (the part review questions) for that part of the book, using study mode. ■ Save the remaining exams to use with the “Final Review” chapter at the end of the book. Introduction xlvii The two modes inside PCPT give you better options for study versus practicing a timed exam event. In study mode, you can see the answers immediately, so you can study the topics more easily. Also, you can choose a subset of the questions in an exam database; for instance, you can view questions from only the chapters in one part of the book. PCPT practice mode lets you practice an exam event somewhat like the actual exam. It gives you a preset number of questions, from all chapters, with a timed event. Practice exam mode also gives you a score for that timed event. How to View Only DIKTA Questions by Chapter or Part Most chapters begin with a “Do I Know This Already?” (DIKTA) quiz. You can take the quiz to start a chapter, take it again during chapter review for more practice, and the “Part Review” sections even suggest that you repeat the questions from all chapters in that part. You can use the DIKTA quiz as printed in the book, or use the PCPT software. The book lists the questions, with the letter answers on the page following the quiz. Appendix C, on the DVD, lists the answers along with an explanation; you might want to keep that PDF handy. Using PCPT for these questions has some advantages. It gives you a little more practice in how to read questions from testing software. Also, the explanations to the questions are conveniently located in the PCPT software. To view these DIKTA questions inside the PCPT software, you need to select Book Questions, which is the way PCPT references questions found inside the printed book. Then you have to deselect all chapters (with a single click), and then select one or more chapters, as follows: Step 1. Start the PCPT software. Step 2. From the main (home) menu, select the item for this product, with a name like CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide, and click Open Exam. Step 3. The top of the next window that appears should list some exams; check the ICND1 Book Questions box, and uncheck the other boxes. This selects the “book” questions (that is, the DIKTA questions from the beginning of each chapter). Step 4. On this same window, click at the bottom of the screen to deselect all objec- tives (chapters). Then select the box beside each chapter in the part of the book you are reviewing. Step 5. Select any other options on the right side of the window. Step 6. Click Start to start reviewing the questions. How to View Part Review Questions The exam databases you get with this book include a database of questions created solely for study during the part review process. DIKTA questions focus more on facts, to help you determine whether you know the facts contained within the chapter. The part review ques- tions instead focus more on application of those facts to typical real scenarios, and look more like real exam questions. xlviii CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide To view these questions, follow the same process as you did with DIKTA/book questions, but select the Part Review database rather than the book database. PCPT has a clear name for this database: Part Review Questions. About Mind Maps Mind maps are a type of visual organization tool that you can use for many purposes. For instance, you can use mind maps as an alternative way to take notes. You can also use mind maps to improve how your brain organizes concepts. Mind maps improve your brain’s connections and relationships between ideas. When you spend time thinking about an area of study, and organize your ideas into a mind map, you strength- en existing mental connections and create new connections, all into your own frame of reference. In short, mind maps help you internalize what you learn. Each mind map begins with a blank piece of paper or blank window in a mind mapping application. You then add a large central idea, with branches that move out in any direction. The branches contain smaller concepts, ideas, commands, pictures, whatever idea needs to be represented. Any concepts that can be grouped should be put near each other. As need be, you can create deeper and deeper branches, although for this book’s purposes, most mind maps will not go beyond a couple of levels. NOTE Many books have been written about mind maps, but Tony Buzan often gets credit for formalizing and popularizing mind maps. You can learn more about mind maps at his website, www.thinkbuzan.com. For example, Figure I-5 shows a sample mind map that begins to output some of the IPv6 content from Part VIII of the ICND1 book. You might create this kind of mind map when reviewing IPv6 addressing concepts, starting with the big topic of “IPv6 addressing,” and then writing down random terms and ideas. As you start to organize them mentally, you draw lines connecting the ideas, reorganize them, and eventually reach the point where you believe the organization of ideas makes sense to you. Figure I-5 Sample Mind Map Mind maps may be the least popular but most effective study tool suggested in this book. I personally find a huge improvement in learning new areas of study when I mind map; I hope you will make the effort to try these tools and see if they work well for you too. http://www.thinkbuzan.com Introduction xlix Finally, for mind mapping tools, you can just draw them on a blank piece of paper, or find and download a mind map application. I have used Mind Node Pro on a Mac, and we build the sample mind maps with XMIND, which has free versions for Windows, Linux, and OS X. About Building Hands-On Skills You need skills in using Cisco routers and switches, specifically the Cisco command-line interface (CLI). The Cisco CLI is a text-based command-and-response user interface; you type a command, and the device (a router or switch) displays messages in response. To answer sim and simlet questions on the exams, you need to know a lot of commands, and you need to be able to navigate to the right place in the CLI to use those commands. This next section walks through the options of what is included in the book, with a brief description of lab options outside the book. Config Lab Exercises Some router and switch features require multiple configuration commands. Part of the skill you need to learn is to remember which configuration commands work together, which ones are required, and which ones are optional. So, the challenge level goes beyond just picking the right parameters on one command. You have to choose which commands to use, in which combination, typically on multiple devices. And getting good at that kind of task requires practice. The Config Labs feature, introduced as a new feature in this edition of the book, helps provide that practice. Each lab presents a sample lab topology, with some requirements, and you have to decide what to configure on each device. The answer then shows a sample configuration. You job is to create the configuration, and then check your answer versus the supplied answer. Also for the first time, this edition places the content not only outside the book but also onto the author’s blog site. To reach my blog sites for ICND1 content or for ICND2 con- tent (two different blogs), you can start at my blog launch site (blog.certskills.com), and click from there. blog.certskills.com/ccent/ Wendell’s CCENT (ICND1): In the menus, navigate to Hands On… Config Lab blog.certskills.com/ccna/ Wendell’s CCNA (ICND2): In the menus, navigate to Hands On… Config Lab Both blogs are geared toward helping you pass the exams, so feel free to look around. Note that the Config Lab posts should show an image like this in the summary: Figure I-6 Config Lab Logo in the Author’s Blogs l CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide These Config Labs have several benefits, including the following: Untethered and responsive: Do them from anywhere, from any web browser, from your phone or tablet, untethered from the book or DVD. Designed for idle moments: Each lab is designed as a 5- to 10-minute exercise if all you are doing is typing in a text editor or writing your answer on paper. Two outcomes, both good: Practice getting better and faster with basic configuration, or if you get lost, you have discovered a topic that you can now go back and reread to complete your knowledge. Either way, you are a step closer to being ready for the exam! Blog format: Allows easy adds and changes by me, and easy comments by you. Self-assessment: As part of final review, you should be able to do all the Config Labs, without help, and with confidence. Note that the blog organizes these Config Lab posts by book chapter, so you can easily use these at both chapter review and part review. See the “Your Study Plan” element that fol- lows the Introduction for more details about those review sections. A Quick Start with Pearson Network Simulator Lite The decision of how to get hands-on skills can be a little scary at first. The good news: You have a free and simple first step to experience the CLI: Install and use the Pearson NetSim Lite that comes with this book. This book comes with a lite version of the best-selling CCNA Network Simulator from Pearson, which provides you with a means, right now, to experience the Cisco CLI. No need to go buy real gear or buy a full simulator to start learning the CLI. Just install it from the DVD in the back of this book. The labs with this latest version of NetSim Lite includes labs associated with Part II of this book. Part I includes concepts only, with Part II being the first part with commands. So, make sure and use the NetSim Lite to learn the basics of the CLI to get a good start. Of course, one reason that NetSim Lite comes on the DVD is that the publisher hopes you will buy the full product. However, even if you do not use the full product, you can still learn from the labs that come with NetSim Lite while deciding about what options to pursue. NOTE The ICND1 and ICND2 books each contain a different version of the Sim Lite product, each with labs that match the book content. If you bought both books, make sure you install both Sim Lite products. The Pearson Network Simulator The Config Labs and the Pearson Network Simulator Lite both fill specific needs, and they both come with the book. However, you need more than those two tools. The single best option for lab work to do along with this book is the paid version of the Pearson Network Simulator. This simulator product simulates Cisco routers and switches so that you can learn for the CCENT and CCNA R&S certifications. But more importantly, it focuses on learning for the exam by providing a large number of useful lab exercises. Reader surveys tell us that those people who use the Simulator along with the book love the learning process, and rave about how the book and Simulator work well together. Introduction li Of course, you need to make a decision for yourself, and consider all the options. Thankfully, you can get a great idea of how the full Simulator product works by using the Pearson Network Simulator Lite product include with the book. Both have the same base code and same user interface, and the same types of labs. Try the Lite version, and check out the full product. There is a full product for CCENT only, and another for CCNA R&S (which includes all the labs in the CCENT product, plus others for the ICND2 parts of the content). Note that the Simulator and the books work on a different release schedule. For a time in 2016, the Simulator will be the Simulator created for the previous versions of the exams (ICND1 100-101, ICND2 200-101, and CCNA 200-120). That product includes approxi- mately 80 percent of the CLI topics in the ICND1 100-105 and 200-105 books. So during that time, the Simulator is still very useful. On a practical note, when you want to do labs when reading a chapter or doing part review, the Simulator organizes the labs to match the book. Just look for “Sort by Chapter” tab in the Simulator’s user interface. However, during the months in 2016 for which the Simulator is the older edition listing the older exams in the title, you will need to refer to a PDF that lists those labs versus this book’s organization. You can find that PDF on the book product page under the Downloads tab here: www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205804. More Lab Options If you decide against using the full Pearson Network Simulator, you still need hands-on experience. You should plan to use some lab environment to practice as much CLI as possible. First, you can use real Cisco routers and switches. You can buy them, new or used, or bor- row them at work. You can rent them for a fee. If you have the right mix of gear, you could even do the Config Lab exercises from my blog on that gear, or try and re-create examples from the book. Cisco offers a virtualization product that lets you run router and switch operating system (OS) images in a virtual environment. This tool, the Virtual Internet Routing Lab (VIRL; http://virl.cisco.com), lets you create a lab topology, start the topology, and connect to real router and switch OS images. Check out http://virl.cisco.com for more information. You can even rent virtual Cisco router and switch lab pods from Cisco, in an offering called Cisco Learning Labs (www.cisco.com/go/learninglabs). All these previously mentioned options cost some money, but the next two are generally free to the user, but with a different catch for each. First, GNS3 works somewhat like VIRL, creating a virtual environment running real Cisco IOS. However, GNS3 is not a Cisco prod- uct, and cannot provide you with the IOS images for legal reasons. Cisco also makes a simulator that works very well as a learning tool: Cisco Packet Tracer. However, Cisco intends Packet Tracer for use by people currently enrolled in Cisco Networking Academy courses, and not for the general public. So, if you are part of a Cisco Academy, definitely use Packet Tracer. This book does not tell you what option to use, but you should plan on getting some hands- on practice somehow. The important thing to know is that most people need to practice using the Cisco CLI to be ready to pass these exams. http://www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205804 http://virl.cisco.com http://virl.cisco.com http://www.cisco.com/go/learninglabs lii CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide For More Information If you have any comments about the book, submit them via www.ciscopress.com.

I trust that your time will be well spent. http://www.ciscopress.com http://www.cisco.com/go/ccna http://www.cisco.com/go/ccent This page intentionally left blank Your Study Plan You just got this book. You have probably already read (or quickly skimmed) the Introduction. You are probably now wondering whether to start reading here or skip ahead to Chapter 1, “Introduction to TCP/IP Networking.” Stop to read this section about how to create your own study plan for the exam(s) you plan to take (ICND1 100-105, ICND2 200-105, and/or CCNA 200-125). Your study will go much better if you take time (maybe 15 minutes) to think about a few key points about how to study before starting on this journey. That is what this section will help you do. A Brief Perspective on Cisco Certification Exams Cisco sets the bar pretty high for passing the ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA R&S exams. Most anyone can study and pass these exams, but it takes more than just a quick read through the book and the cash to pay for the exam. The challenge of these exams comes from many angles. Each of these exams covers a lot of concepts and many commands specific to Cisco devices. Beyond knowledge, these Cisco exams also require deep skills. You must be able to analyze and predict what really happens in a network. You must be able to configure Cisco devices to work correctly in those net- works. And you must be ready to troubleshoot problems when the network does not work correctly. The more challenging questions on these exams work a lot like a jigsaw puzzle, but with four out of every five puzzle pieces not even in the room. To solve the puzzle, you have to mentally re-create the missing pieces. To do that, you must know each networking concept and remember how the concepts work together. For instance, the ICND1 exam includes many troubleshooting topics. A simple question might ask you why a host cannot communicate with some server. The question would sup- ply some of the information, like some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, as represented with the white pieces in Figure 1. You have to apply your knowledge of IPv4 routing, IP addressing, and Ethernet LAN switching to the scenario in the question to come up with some of the other pieces of the puzzle. For a given question, some pieces of the puzzle may remain a mystery, but with enough of the puzzle filled in, you should be able to answer the question. And some pieces will just remain unknown for a given question. These skills require that you prepare by doing more than just reading and memorizing what you read. Of course, you need to read many pages in this book to learn many individual facts and how these facts relate to each other. But a big part of this book lists exercises beyond reading, exercises that help you build the skills to solve these networking puzzles. Predict Configuration: RIPv2 on Routers Given: Output of show mac address-table Given: Router Topology Drawing Calculate: IPv4 subnet IDs Predict Output: show ip route Predict Output: show ip arp Figure 1 Filling In Puzzle Pieces with Your Analysis Skills Five Study Plan Steps These exams are challenging, but many people pass them every day. So, what do you need to do to be ready to pass, beyond reading and remembering all the facts? You need to develop skills. You need to mentally link each idea with other related ideas. Doing that requires additional work. To help you along the way, the next few pages give you five key planning steps to take so that you can more effectively build those skills and make those connections, before you dive into this exciting but challenging world of learning network- ing on Cisco gear. Step 1: Think in Terms of Parts and Chapters The first step in your study plan is to get the right mindset about the size and nature of the task you have set out to accomplish. This is a large book. So you cannot think about the book as one huge task or you might get discouraged. Besides, you never sit down to read 900 pages in one study session. So break the task down into smaller tasks. The good news here is that the book is designed with obvious breakpoints and built-in extensive review activities. In short, the book is more of a study system than a book. So the first step in your study plan is to visualize the book not as one large book, but as 9 parts. Then, within each part, visualize an average of 4 chapters. Your study plan has you working through the chapters in each part, and then reviewing the material in that part before moving on, as shown in Figure 2. 4 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Chapter 3 Review Final Review Practice Exams Do Labs Review Concepts Practice Subnetting . . . Chapter 4 Review Chapter 1 Review Chapter 2 Review Chapter 5 Review P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 8 Review Chapter 9 Review Chapter 6 Review Chapter 7 Review P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 12 Review Chapter 10 Review Chapter 11 Review P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 15 Review Chapter 16 Review Chapter 13 Review Chapter 14 Review P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 19 Review Chapter 20 Review Chapter 17 Review Chapter 18 Review P A R T R E V I E W Part I Part II Part III Part VPart IV Chapter 23 Review Chapter 24 Review Chapter 21 Review Chapter 22 Review P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 27 Review Chapter 25 Review Chapter 26 Review P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 30 Review Chapter 31 Review Chapter 28 Review Chapter 29 Review P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 35 Review Chapter 36 Review Chapter 33 Review Chapter 34 Review Part VI Part VII Part VIII Part IV P A R T R E V I E W Chapter 32 Review Figure 2 9 Parts, with an Average of 4 Chapters Each, with Part Reviews Now your plan has the following: 1 large task: Read and master all content in the book. 9 medium tasks/book: Read and master a part. 4 small tasks/part: Read and master a chapter. Step 2: Build Your Study Habits Around the Chapter For your second step, possibly the most important step, approach each chapter with the same process: read it, and then study the chapter before moving on. Each chapter follows the same design with three parts, as shown in Figure 3. The chapter pre-quiz (called a DIKTA quiz, or Do I Know This Already? quiz) helps you decide how much time to spend reading versus skimming the core of the chapter, called the Foundation Topics. The Chapter Review section then gives you instructions about how to study and review what you just read. Take Quiz 1) In-Chapter, or... 2) Companion Website 3) DVD High Score (Skim) Foundation Topics Low Score (Read) Foundation Topics Foundation Topics Chapter ReviewDIKTA Quiz Figure 3 Suggested Approach to Each Chapter The book has no long chapters, on purpose. They average just over 20 pages for the Foundation Topics. By keeping the size reasonable, you can complete all of a chapter in one or two short study sessions. Go into each study session that begins a new chapter thinking that you have a chance to complete the chapter, or at least make a great start on it. And if you do not have enough time, look for the major headings inside the chapter—each chapter Your Study Plan 5 has two to three major headings, and those make a great place to stop reading when you need to wait to complete the reading in the next study sessions. The Chapter Review tasks are very important to your exam-day success. Doing these tasks after you’ve read the chapter really does help you get ready. Do not put off using these tasks until later! The chapter-ending review tasks help you with the first phase of deepening your knowledge and skills of the key topics, remembering terms, and linking the concepts together in your brain so that you can remember how it all fits together. The following list describes most of the activities you will find in the “Chapter Review” sections: ■ Review key topics ■ Review key terms ■ Repeat the DIKTA questions ■ Review memory tables ■ Re-create config checklists ■ Review command tables ■ Do lab exercises ■ Do subnetting exercises Check out the upcoming section titled “Find Review Activities on the Web and DVD?” later in this planning section for more details. Step 3: Use Book Parts for Major Milestones Studies show that to master a concept and/or skill, you should plan to go through multiple study sessions to review the concept and to practice the skill. The “Chapter Review” section at the end of each chapter is the first such review, while the Part Review, at the end of each part, acts as that second review. Plan time to do the Part Review task at the end of each part, using the Part Review elements found at the end of each Part. You should expect to spend about as much time on one Part Review as you would on one entire chapter, or maybe a little more for some parts. So in terms of planning your time, think of the Part Review itself as another chapter. Figure 4 lists the names of the parts in this book, with some color coding. Note that Parts II and III are related (Ethernet), and Parts IV through VII are also related (IP version 4). Each part ends with a Part Review section of 2 to 4 pages, with notes about what tools and activi- ties to use. Ethernet LANs: Design, VLANs, and Troubleshooting (10-12) Implementing Basic Ethernet LANs (6-9) Network Device Management (33-36)IP Version 6 (28-32) IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting (13-16) Implementing IPv4 (17-20) IPv4 Design and Troubleshooting (21-24) IPv4 Services: ACLs and NAT (25-27) 2 9 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 Network Fundamentals (1-5) Figure 4 Parts as Major Milestones 6 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Chapter Review and Part Review differ in some ways. Chapter Review tasks tend to provide a lot of context, so you can focus on mentally adding a specific piece of knowledge, or practicing a specific skill. Part Review activities instead remove a lot of the context, more like real life and the real exams. Removing that context means that you have to exercise your own knowledge and skills. The result: You uncover your weaknesses. The better you become at uncovering weaknesses, and then learning what you are missing in that area, the better prepared you will be for the exam. The Part Review sections use the following kinds of tools in additional to some of the same tools used for Chapter Review: ■ Mind maps ■ Part Review questions with PCPT ■ Labs Also, consider setting a goal date for finishing each part of the book (and a reward, as well). Plan a break, some family time, some time out exercising, eating some good food, whatever helps you get refreshed and motivated for the next part. Step 4: Use the Final Review Chapter to Refine Skills and Uncover Weaknesses Your fourth step has one overall task: Follow the details outlined in Chapter 37, “Final Review,” at the end of this book for what to do between finishing the book and taking the exam. The “Final Review” chapter has two major goals. First, it helps you further develop the analytical skills you need to answer the more complicated questions on the exam. Many questions require that you connect ideas about concepts, configuration, verification, and troubleshooting. The closer you get to taking the exam, the less reading you should do, and the more you should do other learning activities; this chapter’s tasks give you activities to further develop these skills. The tasks in the “Final Review” chapter also help you uncover your weak areas. This final element gives you repetition with high-challenge exam questions, uncovering any gaps in your knowledge. Many of the questions are purposefully designed to test your knowledge of the most common mistakes and misconceptions, helping you avoid some of the common pitfalls people experience with the actual exam. Step 5: Set Goals and Track Your Progress Your fifth study plan step spans the entire timeline of your study effort. Before you start reading the book and doing the rest of these study tasks, take the time to make a plan, set some goals, and be ready to track your progress. While making lists of tasks may or may not appeal to you, depending on your personality, goal setting can help everyone studying for these exams. And to do the goal setting, you need to know what tasks you plan to do. NOTE If you read this, and decide that you want to try to do better with goal setting beyond your exam study, check out a blog series I wrote about planning your networking career here: http://blog.certskills.com/ccna/tag/development-plan/. http://blog.certskills.com/ccna/tag/development-plan/ Your Study Plan 7 As for the list of tasks to do when studying, you do not have to use a detailed task list. (You could list every single task in every chapter-ending Chapter Review section, every task in the Part Reviews, and every task in the “Final Review” chapter.) However, listing the major tasks can be enough. You should track at least two tasks for each typical chapter: reading the “Foundation Topics” section and doing the Chapter Review at the end of the chapter. And, of course, do not forget to list tasks for Part Reviews and Final Review. Table 1 shows a sample for Part I of this book. Table 1 Sample Excerpt from a Planning Table Element Task Goal Date First Date Completed Second Date Completed (Optional) Chapter 1 Read Foundation Topics Chapter 1 Do Chapter Review tasks Chapter 2 Read Foundation Topics Chapter 2 Do Chapter Review tasks Chapter 3 Read Foundation Topics Chapter 3 Do Chapter Review tasks Part I Review Do Part Review activities NOTE Appendix M, “Study Planner,” on the DVD that comes with this book, contains a complete planning checklist like Table 1 for the tasks in this book. This spreadsheet allows you to update and save the file to note your goal dates and the tasks you have completed. Use your goal dates as a way to manage your study, and not as a way to get discouraged if you miss a date. Pick reasonable dates that you can meet. When setting your goals, think about how fast you read and the length of each chapter’s “Foundation Topics” section, as listed in the table of contents. Then, when you finish a task sooner than planned, move up the next few goal dates. If you miss a few dates, do not start skipping the tasks listed at the ends of the chapters! Instead, think about what is impacting your schedule—real life, commitment, and so on— and either adjust your goals or work a little harder on your study. Things to Do Before Starting the First Chapter Now that you understand the big ideas behind a good study plan for the book, take a few more minutes for a few overhead actions that will help. Before leaving this section, look at some other tasks you should do either now, or around the time you are reading the first few chapters, to help make a good start in the book. Find Review Activities on the Web and DVD The earlier editions of the book have used review activities that relied on the chapter, plus PDF appendixes found on the DVD. Some activities also rely on the PCPT testing software. 8 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide This edition is the first Cisco Press certification guide to offer a large set of apps to use instead of the traditional study features. The Introduction’s section titled “A Big New Feature: Review Applications” detailed some of the reasons. I encourage you to go ahead and access the book’s companion website to find the review apps and explore. Also, spin the DVD, and find the review apps there. Both methods orga- nize the review activities by chapter and by part. Note that this book includes the traditional methods of review as well, with instructions in the book, and matching PDF appendixes in some cases. For instance, all the subnetting exercises can be done in an app, but those same exercises exist in DVD-only appendixes— you choose which works better for you. Should I Plan to Use the Two-Exam Path or One-Exam Path? You do not have to make this choice today, but you can be mulling the decision while you study. To get a CCNA Routing and Switching certification, you choose either a one-exam or two- exam path. Which should you use? The following is my opinion, but it’s based on chatter and opinions from readers from many years. You can consider the one-exam path if ■ You already know about half the topics well, through prior experience or study. ■ You have already proven that you are excellent at learning through self-study. Otherwise, in my opinion, you would be better off taking the two-exam path. First, there is no cost savings for most people with the one-exam path. Check the exam prices in your coun- try, for ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA, and then make some comparisons. Assume you pass the tests on the first try: traditionally, the cost is identical for both the ICND1 + ICND2 path and the CCNA path. Or, assume that you fail each exam once: again, the costs are identical. Next, consider the number of topics. From a content perspective, CCNA = ICND1 + ICND2. So, both paths require learning the same content. Next, which would you rather have done in school: take a final exam over a single semes- ter’s material, or a final exam covering the whole year? It is just harder to prepare for an exam that covers more material, so the two-exam path gain has an advantage. Finally, the most compelling reason for the two-exam path is that you probably have no experience with Cisco exams yet. I hope you have a chance to pass many Cisco exams dur- ing your career. The two-exam path gets you to that first exam attempt sooner, and the exam experience teaches you things about the exam and yourself that no study tool can teach you. Thankfully, you do not have to decide now. In fact, you can study the entire ICND1 book and all the while ponder whether to use the one-exam or two-exam path to CCNA R&S. At that point, you can make a better decision about which path works better for you. Study Options for Those Taking the 200-125 CCNA Exam Studying for the two-exam path has an obvious approach: just use the ICND1 book for the ICND1 exam, and the ICND2 book for the ICND2 exam. Simple enough. Your Study Plan 9 If you do plan to take the 200-125 CCNA R&S exam, you have a couple of study options. First, to be clear: The 200-125 CCNA exam covers the topics in the combined ICND1 and ICND2 books. So, using both the ICND1 and ICND2 books covers everything for the 200-125 CCNA R&S exam. The only question is when to read each part of the two books. You have two reasonable options when going with the one-exam option: ■ Complete all the ICND1 book, then move on to the ICND2 book. ■ Move back and forth between the ICND1 and ICND2 books, by part, based on topics, as shown in Figure 5. The first option is pretty obvious, but the second one is less obvious. Figure 5 shows a study plan in which you complete the Ethernet parts in the ICND1, then the Ethernet part in ICND2. Similarly, you complete the IPv4 parts in ICND1, then ICND2, and then the IPv6 part in both books, and then the final part in both books. ICND1 ICND2 IV: IP Version 4 Addressing and Subnetting V: Implementing IPV4 VI: IPv4 Design and Troubleshooting VII: IPv4 Services: ACLs and NAT VIII: IP Version 6 IX: Network Device Management I: Networking Fundamentals II: Implementing Basic Ethernet LANs III: Ethernet: Design, VLANs, Troubleshooting I: Ethernet LANs II: IPv4 Routing Protocols III: Wide Area Networks IV: IPv4 Services: ACLs and QoS V: IPv4 Routing and Troubleshooting VI: IP Version 6 VII: Miscellaneous 1 6 2 4 3 5 7 Figure 5 Alternate Reading Plan for CCNA: Moving Between Books by Part Personally, I am a fan of completing the ICND1 book completely, and then moving on to the ICND2 book. However, for those of you with a large amount of experience already, this alternate reading plan may work well. 10 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Other Small Tasks Before Getting Started You need to do a few overhead tasks to install software, find some PDFs, and so on. You can do these tasks now or do them in your spare moments when you need a study break during the first few chapters of the book. But do these early. That way, if you do stumble upon an installation problem, you have time to work through it before you need a particular tool. Register (for free) at the Cisco Learning Network (CLN, http://learningnetwork.cisco.com) and join the CCENT/CCNA R&S study group. This group allows you to both lurk and par- ticipate in discussions about topics related to the ICND1 exam, ICND2 exam, and CCNA R&S exam. Register (for free), join the groups, and set up an email filter to redirect the messages to a separate folder. Even if you do not spend time reading all the posts yet, later, when you have time to read, you can browse through the posts to find interesting topics (or just search the posts from the CLN website). Explore the electronic elements of this book, as detailed in the Introduction’s section titled “How to Get the Electronic Elements of This Book.” That includes the installation of the PCPT and Sim Lite software. Also find my blog site as listed in the Introduction, and bookmark the pages that list the config labs, to have those handy for later study. (The URL is http://blog.certskills.com/ccent/category/hands-on/config-lab.) Getting Started: Now Now dive in to your first of many short, manageable tasks: reading the relatively short Chapter 1. Enjoy! http://learningnetwork.cisco.com http://blog.certskills.com/ccent/category/hands-on/config-lab This page intentionally left blank This first part of the book introduces the most important topics in TCP/IP networking. Chapter 1 provides a broad look at TCP/IP, introducing the common terms, big concepts, and major protocols for TCP/IP. Chapters 2 through 5 each look more deeply at a single portion of TCP/IP, as follows: Chapter 2 focuses on links between nearby devices (local-area networks, or LANs). Chapter 3 focuses on links between far-away devices (wide-area networks, or WANs). Chapter 4 focuses on the rules of IP routing, which pulls the LAN and WAN links of Chapters 2 and 3 together by forwarding data all the way from one user device to another. Chapter 5 focuses on what happens on the endpoint devices in the network, with how they transmit data and how the applications interface to the network. Of these chapters, note that this book explores the topics from Chapter 2 (LANs) and Chapter 4 (IP routing) in much more detail. Part I Networking Fundamentals Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications Part I Review CHAPTER 1 Introduction to TCP/IP Networking This chapter covers the following exam topics: 1.0 Network Fundamentals 1.1 Compare and contrast OSI and TCP/IP models 1.2 Compare and contrast TCP and UDP protocols Welcome to the first chapter in your study for CCENT and CCNA! This chapter begins Part I, which focuses on the basics of networking. Because networks require all the devices to follow the rules, this part starts with a discussion of networking models, which gives you a big-picture view of the networking rules. You can think of a networking model as you think of a set of architectural plans for build- ing a house. A lot of different people work on building your house, such as framers, elec- tricians, bricklayers, painters, and so on. The blueprint helps ensure that all the different pieces of the house work together as a whole. Similarly, the people who make networking products, and the people who use those products to build their own computer networks, follow a particular networking model. That networking model defines rules about how each part of the network should work, as well as how the parts should work together, so that the entire network functions correctly. The CCNA exams include detailed coverage of one networking model: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ( TCP/IP). TCP/IP is the most pervasively used network- ing model in the history of networking. You can find support for TCP/IP on practically every computer operating system (OS) in existence today, from mobile phones to main- frame computers. Every network built using Cisco products today supports TCP/IP. And not surprisingly, the CCNA Routing and Switching exams focus heavily on TCP/IP. The exams also compare TCP/IP to a second networking model, called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. Historically, OSI was the first large effort to cre- ate a vendor-neutral networking model. Because of that timing, many of the terms used in networking today come from the OSI model, so this chapter’s section on OSI discusses OSI and the related terminology . “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

The chapter begins with a brief introduction of how most people view a network, which hopefully connects with where you are to start your CCNA journey. The middle of this chapter introduces net- working by explaining some of the key features of TCP/IP. The chapter closes with some additional concepts and terminology related to the OSI model. Perspectives on Networking So, you are new to networking. Like many people, your perspective about networks might be that of a user of the network, as opposed to the network engineer who builds networks. For some, your view of networking might be based on how you use the Internet, from home, using a high-speed Internet connection like digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable TV, as shown in Figure 1-1. The Internet Ethernet Cable CATV Cable Wireless DSL Figure 1-1 End-User Perspective on High-Speed Internet Connections The top part of the figure shows a typical high-speed cable Internet user. The PC connects to a cable modem using an Ethernet cable. The cable modem then connects to a cable TV (CATV) outlet in the wall using a round coaxial cable—the same kind of cable used to con- nect your TV to the CATV wall outlet. Because cable Internet services provide service con- tinuously, the user can just sit down at the PC and start sending email, browsing websites, making Internet phone calls, and using other tools and applications. The lower part of the figure uses two different technologies. First, the tablet computer uses wireless technology that goes by the name wireless local-area network (wireless LAN), or Wi-Fi, instead of using an Ethernet cable. In this example, the router uses a different tech- nology, DSL, to communicate with the Internet. Both home-based networks and networks built for use by a company make use of similar networking technologies. The Information Technology (IT) world refers to a network cre- ated by one corporation, or enterprise, for the purpose of allowing its employees to com- municate, as an enterprise network. The smaller networks at home, when used for business purposes, often go by the name small office/home office (SOHO) networks.

People realize that they use a network for many tasks. PC users might realize that their PC connects through an Ethernet cable to a matching wall outlet, as shown at the top of Figure 1-2. Those same users might use wireless LANs with their laptop when going to a meeting in the conference room as well. Figure 1-2 shows these two end-user perspectives on an enterprise network . Enterprise Network Ethernet Cable Wireless SW1 Figure 1-2 Example Representation of an Enterprise Network NOTE In networking diagrams, a cloud represents a part of a network whose details are not important to the purpose of the diagram. In this case, Figure 1-2 ignores the details of how to create an enterprise network. Some users might not even have a concept of the network at all. Instead, these users just enjoy the functions of the network—the ability to post messages to social media sites, make phone calls, search for information on the Internet, listen to music, and download countless apps to their phones—without caring about how it works or how their favorite device con- nects to the network. Regardless of how much you already know about how networks work, this book and the related certifications help you learn how networks do their job. That job is simply this: mov- ing data from one device to another. The rest of this chapter, and the rest of this first part of the book, reveals the basics of how to build both SOHO and enterprise networks so that they can deliver data between two devices. In the building business, much work happens before you nail the first boards together. The process starts with some planning, an understanding of how to build a house, and some architectural blueprints of how to build that specific house. Similarly, the journey toward building any computer network does not begin by installing devices and cables, but instead by looking at the architectural plans for those modern networks: the TCP/IP model. TCP/IP Networking Model A networking model, sometimes also called either a networking architecture or network- ing blueprint, refers to a comprehensive set of documents. Individually, each document describes one small function required for a network; collectively, these documents define everything that should happen for a computer network to work. Some documents define a protocol, which is a set of logical rules that devices must follow to communicate. Other documents define some physical requirements for networking. For example, a document could define the voltage and current levels used on a particular cable when transmitting data. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 19 1 You can think of a networking model as you think of an architectural blueprint for build- ing a house. Sure, you can build a house without the blueprint. However, the blueprint can ensure that the house has the right foundation and structure so that it will not fall down, and it has the correct hidden spaces to accommodate the plumbing, electrical, gas, and so on. Also, the many different people that build the house using the blueprint—such as fram- ers, electricians, bricklayers, painters, and so on—know that if they follow the blueprint, their part of the work should not cause problems for the other workers. Similarly, you could build your own network—write your own software, build your own networking cards, and so on—to create a network. However, it is much easier to simply buy and use products that already conform to some well-known networking model or blueprint. Because the networking product vendors build their products with some networking model in mind, their products should work well together. History Leading to TCP/IP Today, the world of computer networking uses one networking model: TCP/IP. However, the world has not always been so simple. Once upon a time, networking protocols didn’t exist, including TCP/IP. Vendors created the first networking protocols; these protocols supported only that vendor’s computers. For example, IBM published its Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking model in 1974. Other vendors also created their own propri- etary networking models. As a result, if your company bought computers from three ven- dors, network engineers often had to create three different networks based on the network- ing models created by each company, and then somehow connect those networks, making the combined networks much more complex. The left side of Figure 1-3 shows the general idea of what a company’s enterprise network might have looked like back in the 1980s, before TCP/IP became common in enterprise internetworks. IBM DEC 1980s IBM DEC TCP/IP Other Vendor Other Vendor 1990s TCP/IP 2000s Figure 1-3 Historical Progression: Proprietary Models to the Open TCP/IP Model Although vendor-defined proprietary networking models often worked well, having an open, vendor-neutral networking model would aid competition and reduce complexity. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) took on the task to create such a model, starting as early as the late 1970s, beginning work on what would become known as the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking model. ISO had a noble goal for the OSI model: to 20 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide standardize data networking protocols to allow communication among all computers across the entire planet. ISO worked toward this ambitious and noble goal, with participants from most of the technologically developed nations on Earth participating in the process. A second, less-formal effort to create an open, vendor-neutral, public networking model sprouted forth from a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contract. Researchers at various universities volunteered to help further develop the protocols surrounding the original DoD work. These efforts resulted in a competing open networking model called TCP/IP. During the 1990s, companies began adding OSI, TCP/IP, or both to their enterprise net- works. However, by the end of the 1990s, TCP/IP had become the common choice, and OSI fell away. The center part of Figure 1-3 shows the general idea behind enterprise networks in that decade—still with networks built upon multiple networking models but including TCP/IP. Here in the twenty-first century, TCP/IP dominates. Proprietary networking models still exist, but they have mostly been discarded in favor of TCP/IP. The OSI model, whose development suffered in part because of a slower formal standardization process as com- pared with TCP/IP, never succeeded in the marketplace. And TCP/IP, the networking model originally created almost entirely by a bunch of volunteers, has become the most prolific network model ever, as shown on the right side of Figure 1-3. In this chapter, you will read about some of the basics of TCP/IP. Although you will learn some interesting facts about TCP/IP, the true goal of this chapter is to help you understand what a networking model or networking architecture really is and how it works. Also in this chapter, you will learn about some of the jargon used with OSI. Will any of you ever work on a computer that is using the full OSI protocols instead of TCP/IP? Probably not. However, you will often use terms relating to OSI. Overview of the TCP/IP Networking Model The TCP/IP model both defines and references a large collection of protocols that allow computers to communicate. To define a protocol, TCP/IP uses documents called Requests For Comments (RFC). (You can find these RFCs using any online search engine.) The TCP/IP model also avoids repeating work already done by some other standards body or vendor con- sortium by simply referring to standards or protocols created by those groups. For example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) defines Ethernet LANs; the TCP/IP model does not define Ethernet in RFCs, but refers to IEEE Ethernet as an option. An easy comparison can be made between telephones and computers that use TCP/IP. You go to the store and buy a phone from one of a dozen different vendors. When you get home and plug in the phone to the same cable in which your old phone was connected, the new phone works. The phone vendors know the standards for phones in their country and build their phones to match those standards. Similarly, when you buy a new computer today, it implements the TCP/IP model to the point that you can usually take the computer out of the box, plug in all the right cables, turn it on, and it connects to the network. You can use a web browser to connect to your favorite website. How? Well, the OS on the computer implements parts of the TCP/IP model. The Ethernet card, or wireless LAN card, built in to the computer implements some LAN standards referenced by the TCP/IP model. In short, the vendors that created the hard- ware and software implemented TCP/IP. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 21 1 To help people understand a networking model, each model breaks the functions into a small number of categories called layers. Each layer includes protocols and standards that relate to that category of functions. TCP/IP actually has two alternative models, as shown in Figure 1-4. TCP/IP Original Link Application Transport Internet TCP/IP Updated Application Transport Network Data Link Physical Figure 1-4 Two TCP/IP Networking Models The model on the left shows the original TCP/IP model listed in RFC 1122, which breaks TCP/IP into four layers. The top two layers focus more on the applications that need to send and receive data. The bottom layer focuses on how to transmit bits over each indi- vidual link, with the Internet layer focusing on delivering data over the entire path from the original sending computer to the final destination computer. The TCP/IP model on the right shows the more common terms and layers used when people talk about TCP/IP today. It expands the original model’s link layer into two separate layers: data link and physical (similar to the lower two layers of the OSI model). Also, many people commonly use the word “Network” instead of “Internet” for one layer. NOTE The original TCP/IP model’s link layer has also been referred to as the network access and network interface layer. Many of you will have already heard of several TCP/IP protocols, like the examples listed in Table 1-2. Most of the protocols and standards in this table will be explained in more detail as you work through this book. Following the table, this section takes a closer look at the layers of the TCP/IP model . Table 1-2 TCP/IP Architectural Model and Example Protocols TCP/IP Architecture Layer Example Protocols Application HTTP, POP3, SMTP Transport TCP, UDP Internet IP Link Ethernet, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), T1 22 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide TCP/IP Application Layer TCP/IP application layer protocols provide services to the application software running on a computer. The application layer does not define the application itself, but it defines services that applications need. For example, application protocol HTTP defines how web browsers can pull the contents of a web page from a web server. In short, the application layer pro- vides an interface between software running on a computer and the network itself. Arguably, the most popular TCP/IP application today is the web browser. Many major software vendors either have already changed or are changing their application software to support access from a web browser. And thankfully, using a web browser is easy: You start a web browser on your computer and select a website by typing the name of the website, and the web page appears. HTTP Overview What really happens to allow that web page to appear on your web browser? Imagine that Bob opens his browser. His browser has been configured to automatically ask for web server Larry’s default web page, or home page. The general logic looks like Figure 1-5. Web Server - Larry Web Browser - Bob Give me your web page Here is the file home.htm 1 2 Figure 1-5 Basic Application Logic to Get a Web Page So, what really happened? Bob’s initial request actually asks Larry to send his home page back to Bob. Larry’s web server software has been configured to know that the default web page is contained in a file called home.htm. Bob receives the file from Larry and displays the contents of the file in Bob’s web browser window. HTTP Protocol Mechanisms Taking a closer look, this example shows how applications on each endpoint computer— specifically, the web browser application and web server application—use a TCP/IP applica- tion layer protocol. To make the request for a web page and return the contents of the web page, the applications use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP did not exist until Tim Berners-Lee created the first web browser and web server in the early 1990s. Berners-Lee gave HTTP functionality to ask for the contents of web pages, specifically by giving the web browser the ability to request files from the server and giv- ing the server a way to return the content of those files. The overall logic matches what was shown in Figure 1-5; Figure 1-6 shows the same idea, but with details specific to HTTP. NOTE The full version of most web addresses—also called Uniform Resource Locators (URL) or Universal Resource Identifiers (URI)—begins with the letters http, which means that HTTP is used to transfer the web pages. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 23 1 Web Server Larry Web Browser Bob 1 HTTP Header GET home.htm 2 HTTP Header OK Data home.htm Data More of file home.htm 3 Figure 1-6 HTTP GET Request , HTTP Reply, and One Data-Only Message To get the web page from Larry, at Step 1, Bob sends a message with an HTTP header. Generally, protocols use headers as a place to put information used by that protocol. This HTTP header includes the request to “get” a file. The request typically contains the name of the file (home.htm, in this case), or if no filename is mentioned, the web server assumes that Bob wants the default web page. Step 2 in Figure 1-6 shows the response from web server Larry. The message begins with an HTTP header, with a return code (200), which means something as simple as “OK” returned in the header. HTTP also defines other return codes so that the server can tell the browser whether the request worked. (Here is another example: If you ever looked for a web page that was not found, and then received an HTTP 404 “not found” error, you received an HTTP return code of 404.) The second message also includes the first part of the requested file. Step 3 in Figure 1-6 shows another message from web server Larry to web browser Bob, but this time without an HTTP header. HTTP transfers the data by sending multiple messages, each with a part of the file. Rather than wasting space by sending repeated HTTP headers that list the same information, these additional messages simply omit the header. TCP/IP Transport Layer Although many TCP/IP application layer protocols exist, the TCP/IP transport layer includes a smaller number of protocols. The two most commonly used transport layer pro- tocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Transport layer protocols provide services to the application layer protocols that reside one layer higher in the TCP/IP model. How does a transport layer protocol provide a service to a higher-layer protocol? This section introduces that general concept by focusing on a single service provided by TCP: error recovery. Later chapters examine the transport layer in more detail and discuss more functions of the transport layer. TCP Error Recovery Basics To appreciate what the transport layer protocols do, you must think about the layer above the transport layer, the application layer. Why? Well, each layer provides a service to the layer above it, like the error-recovery service provided to application layer protocols by TCP. For example, in Figure 1-5, Bob and Larry used HTTP to transfer the home page from web server Larry to Bob’s web browser. But what would have happened if Bob’s HTTP GET request had been lost in transit through the TCP/IP network? Or, what would have happened if Larry’s response, which included the contents of the home page, had been lost? Well, as you might expect, in either case, the page would not have shown up in Bob’s browser. 24 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide TCP/IP needs a mechanism to guarantee delivery of data across a network. Because many application layer protocols probably want a way to guarantee delivery of data across a net- work, the creators of TCP included an error-recovery feature. To recover from errors, TCP uses the concept of acknowledgments. Figure 1-7 outlines the basic idea behind how TCP notices lost data and asks the sender to try again . Web Server Larry Web Browser Bob 1SEQ = 1 TCP OK HTTP Web Page Data 2SEQ = 2 TCP More Web Page Data Lost! SEQ = 3 TCP Rest of Web Page Data 3 4Send 2 Next TCP Figure 1-7 TCP Error-Recovery Services as Provided to HTTP Figure 1-7 shows web server Larry sending a web page to web browser Bob, using three separate messages. Note that this figure shows the same HTTP headers as Figure 1-6, but it also shows a TCP header. The TCP header shows a sequence number (SEQ) with each message. In this example, the network has a problem, and the network fails to deliver the TCP message (called a segment) with sequence number 2. When Bob receives messages with sequence numbers 1 and 3, but does not receive a message with sequence number 2, Bob realizes that message 2 was lost. That realization by Bob’s TCP logic causes Bob to send a TCP segment back to Larry, asking Larry to send message 2 again. Same-Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions The example in Figure 1-7 also demonstrates a function called adjacent-layer interaction, which refers to the concepts of how adjacent layers in a networking model, on the same computer, work together. In this example, the higher-layer protocol (HTTP) wants error recovery, and the higher layer uses the next lower-layer protocol (TCP) to perform the service of error recovery; the lower layer provides a service to the layer above it. Figure 1-7 also shows an example of a similar function called same-layer interaction. When a particular layer on one computer wants to communicate with the same layer on another computer, the two computers use headers to hold the information that they want to communicate. For example, in Figure 1-7, Larry set the sequence numbers to 1, 2, and 3 so that Bob could notice when some of the data did not arrive. Larry’s TCP process cre- ated that TCP header with the sequence number; Bob’s TCP process received and reacted to the TCP segments. Table 1-3 summarizes the key points about how adjacent layers work together on a single computer and how one layer on one computer works with the same networking layer on another computer. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 25 1 Table 1-3 Summary: Same-Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions Concept Description Same-layer interaction on different computers The two computers use a protocol (an agreed-to set of rules) to communicate with the same layer on another computer. The protocol defined by each layer uses a header that is transmitted between the computers to communicate what each computer wants to do. Header information added by a layer of the sending computer is processed by the same layer of the receiving computer. Adjacent- layer interaction on the same computer On a single computer, one layer provides a service to a higher layer. The software or hardware that implements the higher layer requests that the next lower layer perform the needed function. TCP/IP Network Layer The application layer includes many protocols. The transport layer includes fewer proto- cols, most notably, TCP and UDP. The TCP/IP network layer includes a small number of protocols, but only one major protocol: the Internet Protocol (IP) . In fact, the name TCP/IP is simply the names of the two most common protocols (TCP and IP) separated by a /. IP provides several features, most importantly, addressing and routing. This section begins by comparing IP’s addressing and routing with another commonly known system that uses addressing and routing: the postal service. Following that, this section introduc- es IP addressing and routing. (More details follow in Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing.”) Internet Protocol and the Postal Service Imagine that you just wrote two letters: one to a friend on the other side of the country and one to a friend on the other side of town. You addressed the envelopes and put on the stamps, so both are ready to give to the postal service. Is there much difference in how you treat each letter? Not really. Typically, you would just put them in the same mailbox and expect the postal service to deliver both letters. The postal service, however, must think about each letter separately, and then make a decision of where to send each letter so that it is delivered. For the letter sent across town, the people in the local post office probably just need to put the letter on another truck. For the letter that needs to go across the country, the postal service sends the letter to another post office, then another, and so on, until the letter gets delivered across the country. At each post office, the postal service must process the letter and choose where to send it next. To make it all work, the postal service has regular routes for small trucks, large trucks, planes, boats, and so on, to move letters between postal service sites. The service must be able to receive and forward the letters, and it must make good decisions about where to send each letter next, as shown in Figure 1-8 . 26 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Local Postal Service California Figure 1-8 Postal Service Forwarding (Routing) Letters Still thinking about the postal service, consider the difference between the person sending the letter and the work that the postal service does. The person sending the letters expects that the postal service will deliver the letter most of the time. However, the person send- ing the letter does not need to know the details of exactly what path the letters take. In contrast, the postal service does not create the letter, but it accepts the letter from the cus- tomer. Then, the postal service must know the details about addresses and postal codes that group addresses into larger groups, and it must have the ability to deliver the letters. The TCP/IP application and transport layers act like the person sending letters through the postal service. These upper layers work the same way regardless of whether the endpoint host computers are on the same LAN or are separated by the entire Internet. To send a mes- sage, these upper layers ask the layer below them, the network layer, to deliver the message. The lower layers of the TCP/IP model act more like the postal service to deliver those mes- sages to the correct destinations. To do so, these lower layers must understand the underly- ing physical network because they must choose how to best deliver the data from one host to another. So, what does this all matter to networking? Well, the network layer of the TCP/IP net- working model, primarily defined by the Internet Protocol (IP), works much like the postal service. IP defines that each host computer should have a different IP address, just as the postal service defines addressing that allows unique addresses for each house, apartment, and business. Similarly, IP defines the process of routing so that devices called routers can work like the post office, forwarding packets of data so that they are delivered to the cor- rect destinations. Just as the postal service created the necessary infrastructure to deliver letters—post offices, sorting machines, trucks, planes, and personnel—the network layer defines the details of how a network infrastructure should be created so that the network can deliver data to all computers in the network. NOTE TCP/IP defines two versions of IP: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6). The world still mostly uses IPv4, so this introductory part of the book uses IPv4 for all refer- ences to IP. Later in this book, Part VIII, “IP Version 6,” discusses this newer version of the IP protocol. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 27 1 Internet Protocol Addressing Basics IP defines addresses for several important reasons. First, each device that uses TCP/IP— each TCP/IP host—needs a unique address so that it can be identified in the network. IP also defines how to group addresses together, just like the postal system groups addresses based on postal codes (like ZIP codes in the United States). To understand the basics, examine Figure 1-9, which shows the familiar web server Larry and web browser Bob; but now, instead of ignoring the network between these two com- puters, part of the network infrastructure is included. Addresses: 1.__.__.__ Addresses: 3.__.__.__ Addresses: 2.__.__.__ Larry 1.1.1.1 3.3.3.3 Bob 2.2.2.2 R1 R3 R2 Archie Figure 1-9 Simple TCP/IP Network: Three Routers with IP Addresses Grouped First, note that Figure 1-9 shows some sample IP addresses. Each IP address has four num- bers, separated by periods. In this case, Larry uses IP address 1.1.1.1, and Bob uses 2.2.2.2. This style of number is called a dotted-decimal notation (DDN). Figure 1-9 also shows three groups of addresses. In this example, all IP addresses that begin with 1 must be on the upper left, as shown in shorthand in the figure as 1. . . . All addresses that begin with 2 must be on the right, as shown in shorthand as 2. . . . Finally, all IP addresses that begin with 3 must be at the bottom of the figure. In addition, Figure 1-9 introduces icons that represent IP routers. Routers are networking devices that connect the parts of the TCP/IP network together for the purpose of routing (forwarding) IP packets to the correct destination. Routers do the equivalent of the work done by each post office site: They receive IP packets on various physical interfaces, make decisions based on the IP address included with the packet, and then physically forward the packet out some other network interface. IP Routing Basics The TCP/IP network layer, using the IP protocol, provides a service of forwarding IP pack- ets from one device to another. Any device with an IP address can connect to the TCP/IP network and send packets. This section shows a basic IP routing example for perspective. NOTE The term IP host refers to any device, regardless of size or power, that has an IP address and connects to any TCP/IP network. 28 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Figure 1-10 repeats the familiar case in which web server Larry wants to send part of a web page to Bob, but now with details related to IP. On the lower left, note that server Larry has the familiar application data, HTTP header, and TCP header ready to send. In addition, the message now contains an IP header. The IP header includes a source IP address of Larry’s IP address (1.1.1.1) and a destination IP address of Bob’s IP address (2.2.2.2). Addresses: 2._____ Larry 1.1.1.1 1 2 3 To 2._____ Send to R2 To 2._____ Send Locally Always to R1 Bob 2.2.2.2 IP TCP HTTP Source 1.1.1.1 Destination 2.2.2.2 R1 R3 R2 Figure 1-10 Basic Routing Example Step 1, on the left of Figure 1-10, begins with Larry being ready to send an IP packet. Larry’s IP process chooses to send the packet to some router—a nearby router on the same LAN—with the expectation that the router will know how to forward the packet. (This logic is much like you or me sending all our letters by putting them in a nearby mailbox.) Larry doesn’t need to know anything more about the topology or the other routers. At Step 2, Router R1 receives the IP packet, and R1’s IP process makes a decision. R1 looks at the destination address (2.2.2.2), compares that address to its known IP routes, and chooses to forward the packet to Router R2. This process of forwarding the IP packet is called IP routing (or simply routing). At Step 3, Router R2 repeats the same kind of logic used by Router R1. R2’s IP process will compare the packet’s destination IP address (2.2.2.2) to R2’s known IP routes and make a choice to forward the packet to the right, on to Bob. You will learn IP to more depth than any other protocol while preparing for CCENT and CCNA. Practically half the chapters in this book discuss some feature that relates to addressing, IP routing, and how routers perform routing. TCP/IP Link Layer (Data Link Plus Physical) The TCP/IP model’s original link layer defines the protocols and hardware required to deliver data across some physical network. The term link refers to the physical connections, or links, between two devices and the protocols used to control those links. Just like every layer in any networking model, the TCP/IP link layer provides services to the layer above it in the model. When a host’s or router’s IP process chooses to send an IP packet to another router or host, that host or router then uses link-layer details to send that packet to the next host/router. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 29 1 Because each layer provides a service to the layer above it, take a moment to think about the IP logic related to Figure 1-10. In that example, host Larry’s IP logic chooses to send the IP packet to a nearby router (R1), with no mention of the underlying Ethernet. The Ethernet network, which implements link-layer protocols, must then be used to deliver that packet from host Larry over to router R1. Figure 1-11 shows four steps of what occurs at the link layer to allow Larry to send the IP packet to R1. NOTE Figure 1-11 depicts the Ethernet as a series of lines. Networking diagrams often use this convention when drawing Ethernet LANs, in cases where the actual LAN cabling and LAN devices are not important to some discussion, as is the case here. The LAN would have cables and devices, like LAN switches, which are not shown in this figure. Larry 1.1.1.1 Ethernet IP Packet Eth. IP Packet Encapsulate1 2 Transmit 3 IP Packet 4 De-encapsulate Receive R1 Header Trailer Ethernet IP Packet Eth.Header Trailer Figure 1-11 Larry Using Ethernet to Forward an IP Packet to Router R1 Figure 1-11 shows four steps. The first two occur on Larry, and the last two occur on Router R1, as follows: Step 1. Larry encapsulates the IP packet between an Ethernet header and Ethernet trailer, creating an Ethernet frame. Step 2. Larry physically transmits the bits of this Ethernet frame, using electricity flow- ing over the Ethernet cabling. Step 3. Router R1 physically receives the electrical signal over a cable, and re-creates the same bits by interpreting the meaning of the electrical signals. Step 4. Router R1 de-encapsulates the IP packet from the Ethernet frame by removing and discarding the Ethernet header and trailer. By the end of this process, the link-layer processes on Larry and R1 have worked together to deliver the packet from Larry to Router R1. NOTE Protocols define both headers and trailers for the same general reason, but headers exist at the beginning of the message and trailers exist at the end. The link layer includes a large number of protocols and standards. For example, the link layer includes all the variations of Ethernet protocols, along with several other LAN stan- dards that were more popular in decades past. The link layer includes wide-area network 30 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide (WAN) standards for different physical media, which differ significantly compared to LAN standards because of the longer distances involved in transmitting the data. This layer also includes the popular WAN standards that add headers and trailers as shown generally in Figure 1-11—protocols such as the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Frame Relay. Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” and Chapter 3, “Fundamentals of WANs,” further develop these topics for LANs and WANs, respectively. In short, the TCP/IP link layer includes two distinct functions: functions related to the physical transmission of the data, plus the protocols and rules that control the use of the physical media. The five-layer TCP/IP model simply splits out the link layer into two layers (data link and physical) to match this logic. TCP/IP Model and Terminology Before completing this introduction to the TCP/IP model, this section examines a few remaining details of the model and some related terminology. Comparing the Original and Modern TCP/IP Models The original TCP/IP model defined a single layer—the link layer—below the Internet layer. The functions defined in the original link layer can be broken into two major categories: functions related directly to the physical transmission of data and those only indirectly related to the physical transmission of data. For example, in the four steps shown in Figure 1-11, Steps 2 and 3 were specific to sending the data, but Steps 1 and 4—encapsulation and de-encapsulation—were only indirectly related. This division will become clearer as you read about additional details of each protocol and standard. Today, most documents use a more modern version of the TCP/IP model, as shown in Figure 1-12. Comparing the two, the upper layers are identical, except a name change from Internet to Network. The lower layers differ in that the single link layer in the original model is split into two layers to match the division of physical transmission details from the other functions. Figure 1-12 shows the two versions of the TCP/IP model again, with emphasis on these distinctions. TCP/IP Original Link Application Transport Internet TCP/IP Updated Application Transport Network Data Link Physical Encapsulation, Addressing Bit Transmission Figure 1-12 Link Versus Data Link and Physical Layers Data Encapsulation Terminology As you can see from the explanations of how HTTP, TCP, IP, and Ethernet do their jobs, each layer adds its own header (and for data-link protocols, also a trailer) to the data sup- plied by the higher layer. The term encapsulation refers to the process of putting headers (and sometimes trailers) around some data. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 31 1 Many of the examples in this chapter show the encapsulation process. For example, web server Larry encapsulated the contents of the home page inside an HTTP header in Figure 1-6. The TCP layer encapsulated the HTTP headers and data inside a TCP header in Figure 1-7. IP encapsulated the TCP headers and the data inside an IP header in Figure 1-10. Finally, the Ethernet link layer encapsulated the IP packets inside both a header and a trailer in Figure 1-11. The process by which a TCP/IP host sends data can be viewed as a five-step process. The first four steps relate to the encapsulation performed by the four TCP/IP layers, and the last step is the actual physical transmission of the data by the host. In fact, if you use the five-layer TCP/IP model, one step corresponds to the role of each layer. The steps are sum- marized in the following list: Step 1. Create and encapsulate the application data with any required application layer headers. For example, the HTTP OK message can be returned in an HTTP header, followed by part of the contents of a web page. Step 2. Encapsulate the data supplied by the application layer inside a transport layer header. For end-user applications, a TCP or UDP header is typically used. Step 3. Encapsulate the data supplied by the transport layer inside a network layer (IP) header. IP defines the IP addresses that uniquely identify each computer. Step 4. Encapsulate the data supplied by the network layer inside a data link layer header and trailer. This layer uses both a header and a trailer. Step 5. Transmit the bits. The physical layer encodes a signal onto the medium to transmit the frame. The numbers in Figure 1-13 correspond to the five steps in this list, graphically showing the same concepts. Note that because the application layer often does not need to add a header, the figure does not show a specific application layer header. Application Transport Network Data Link Physical Data Link IP Data Link Data DataTCP DataIP TCP Transmit Bits 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 4 TCP Data Figure 1-13 Five Steps of Data Encapsulation: TCP/IP Names of TCP/IP Messages Finally, take particular care to remember the terms segment, packet, and frame and the meaning of each. Each term refers to the headers (and possibly trailers) defined by a 32 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide particular layer and the data encapsulated following that header. Each term, however, refers to a different layer: segment for the transport layer, packet for the network layer, and frame for the link layer. Figure 1-14 shows each layer along with the associated term. TCP Data IP Data LH Data LT Segment Packet Frame Figure 1-14 Perspectives on Encapsulation and “Data”* * The letters LH and LT stand for link header and link trailer, respectively, and refer to the data link layer header and trailer. Figure 1-14 also shows the encapsulated data as simply “data.” When focusing on the work done by a particular layer, the encapsulated data typically is unimportant. For example, an IP packet can indeed have a TCP header after the IP header, an HTTP header after the TCP head- er, and data for a web page after the HTTP header. However, when discussing IP, you probably just care about the IP header, so everything after the IP header is just called data. So, when drawing IP packets, everything after the IP header is typically shown simply as data. OSI Networking Model At one point in the history of the OSI model, many people thought that OSI would win the battle of the networking models discussed earlier. If that had occurred, instead of running TCP/IP on every computer in the world, those computers would be running with OSI. However, OSI did not win that battle. In fact, OSI no longer exists as a networking model that could be used instead of TCP/IP, although some of the original protocols referenced by the OSI model still exist. So, why is OSI even in this book? Terminology. During those years in which many people thought the OSI model would become commonplace in the world of networking (mostly in the late 1980s and early 1990s), many vendors and protocol documents started using termi- nology from the OSI model. That terminology remains today. So, while you will never need to work with a computer that uses OSI, to understand modern networking terminology, you need to understand something about OSI. Comparing OSI and TCP/IP The OSI model has many similarities to the TCP/IP model from a basic conceptual perspec- tive. It has (seven) layers, and each layer defines a set of typical networking functions. As with TCP/IP, the OSI layers each refer to multiple protocols and standards that implement the functions specified by each layer. In other cases, just as for TCP/IP, the OSI committees did not create new protocols or standards, but instead referenced other protocols that were already defined. For example, the IEEE defines Ethernet standards, so the OSI commit- tees did not waste time specifying a new type of Ethernet; it simply referred to the IEEE Ethernet standards. Today, the OSI model can be used as a standard of comparison to other networking models. Figure 1-15 compares the seven-layer OSI model with both the four-layer and five-layer TCP/IP models. Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 33 1 Link Application Transport Internet TCP/IPTCP/IPOSI Application Transport Network Data Link Physical 5 - 7 4 3 2 1 Transport Session Presentation Application Network Data Link Physical 4 5 6 7 3 2 1 Figure 1-15 OSI Model Compared to the Two TCP/IP Models Next, this section examines two ways in which we still use OSI terminology today: to describe other protocols and to describe the encapsulation process. Along the way, the text briefly examines each layer of the OSI model. Describing Protocols by Referencing the OSI Layers Even today , networking documents often describe TCP/IP protocols and standards by ref- erencing OSI layers, both by layer number and layer name. For example, a common descrip- tion of a LAN switch is “Layer 2 switch,” with “Layer 2” referring to OSI layer 2. Because OSI did have a well-defined set of functions associated with each of its seven layers, if you know those functions, you can understand what people mean when they refer to a product or function by its OSI layer. For another example, TCP/IP’s original Internet layer, as implemented mainly by IP, equates most directly to the OSI network layer. So, most people say that IP is a network layer pro- tocol, or a Layer 3 protocol, using OSI terminology and numbers for the layer. Of course, if you numbered the TCP/IP model, starting at the bottom, IP would be either Layer 2 or 3, depending on what version of the TCP/IP model you care to use. However, even though IP is a TCP/IP protocol, everyone uses the OSI model layer names and numbers when describ- ing IP or any other protocol for that matter. The claim that a particular TCP/IP layer is similar to a particular OSI layer is a general comparison, but not a detailed comparison. The comparison is a little like comparing a car to a truck: Both can get you from point A to point B, but they have many specific differences, like the truck having a truck bed in which to carry cargo. Similarly, both the OSI and TCP/IP network layers define logical addressing and routing. However, the addresses have a different size, and the routing logic even works differently. So the com- parison of OSI layers to other protocol models is a general comparison of major goals, and not a comparison of the specific methods. OSI Layers and Their Functions Today, because most people happen to be much more familiar with TCP/IP functions than with OSI functions, one of the best ways to learn about the function of different OSI lay- ers is to think about the functions in the TCP/IP model and to correlate those with the OSI model. For the purposes of learning, you can think of five of the OSI layers as doing the same kinds of things as the matching five layers in the TCP/IP model. For example, the application layer of each model defines protocols to be used directly by the applications, and the physical layer of each defines the electro-mechanical details of communicating over physical connections. Table 1-4 briefly describes each OSI layer. 34 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Table 1-4 OSI Reference Model Layer Descriptions Layer Functional Description 7 Application layer. Provides an interface from the application to the network by supplying a protocol with actions meaningful to the application, for example, “get web page object.” 6 Presentation layer. This layer negotiates data formats, such as ASCII text, or image types like JPEG. 5 Session layer. This layer provides methods to group multiple bidirectional messages into a workflow for easier management and easier backout of work that happened if the entire workflow fails. 4 Transport layer. In function, much like TCP/IP’s transport layer. This layer focuses on data delivery between the two endpoint hosts (for example, error recovery). 3 Network layer. Like the TCP/IP network (Internet) layer, this layer defines logical addressing, routing (forwarding), and the routing protocols used to learn routes. 2 Data link layer. Like the TCP/IP data link layer, this layer defines the protocols for delivering data over a particular single type of physical network (for example, the Ethernet data link protocols). 1 Physical layer. This layer defines the physical characteristics of the transmission medium, including connectors, pins, use of pins, electrical currents, encoding, light modulation, and so on. Table 1-5 lists a sampling of the devices and protocols and their comparable OSI layers. Note that many network devices must actually understand the protocols at multiple OSI layers, so the layer listed in Table 1-5 actually refers to the highest layer that the device normally thinks about when performing its core work. For example, routers need to think about Layer 3 concepts, but they must also support features at both Layers 1 and 2. Table 1-5 OSI Reference Model: Device and Protocol Examples Layer Name Protocols and Specifications Devices Application, presentation, session (Layers 5–7) Telnet, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, VoIP, SNMP Hosts, firewalls Transport (Layer 4) TCP, UDP Hosts, firewalls Network (Layer 3) IP Router Data link (Layer 2) Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), HDLC LAN switch, wireless access point, cable modem, DSL modem Physical (Layer 1) RJ-45, Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) LAN hub, LAN repeater, cables Besides remembering the basics of the features of each OSI layer (as in Table 1-4), and some protocol and device example at each layer (as in Table 1-5), you should also memo- rize the names of the layers. You can simply memorize them, but some people like to use a mnemonic phrase to make memorization easier. In the following three phrases, the first Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking 35 1 letter of each word is the same as the first letter of an OSI layer name, in the order specified in parentheses: ■ All People Seem To Need Data Processing (Layers 7 to 1) ■ Please Do Not Take Sausage Pizzas Away (Layers 1 to 7) ■ Pew! Dead Ninja Turtles Smell Particularly Awful (Layers 1 to 7) OSI Layering Concepts and Benefits While networking models use layers to help humans categorize and understand the many functions in a network, networking models use layers for many reasons. For example, con- sider another postal service analogy. A person writing a letter does not have to think about how the postal service will deliver a letter across the country. The postal worker in the middle of the country does not have to worry about the contents of the letter. Likewise, networking models that divide functions into different layers enable one software package or hardware device to implement functions from one layer, and assume that other software/ hardware will perform the functions defined by the other layers. The following list summarizes the benefits of layered protocol specifications: ■ Less complex: Compared to not using a layered model, network models break the con- cepts into smaller parts. ■ Standard interfaces: The standard interface definitions between each layer allow mul- tiple vendors to create products that fill a particular role, with all the benefits of open competition. ■ Easier to learn: Humans can more easily discuss and learn about the many details of a protocol specification. ■ Easier to develop: Reduced complexity allows easier program changes and faster prod- uct development. ■ Multivendor interoperability: Creating products to meet the same networking standards means that computers and networking gear from multiple vendors can work in the same network. ■ Modular engineering: One vendor can write software that implements higher layers—for example, a web browser—and another vendor can write software that implements the lower layers—for example, Microsoft’s built-in TCP/IP software in its operating systems. OSI Encapsulation Terminology Like TCP/IP, each OSI layer asks for services from the next lower layer. To provide the ser- vices, each layer makes use of a header and possibly a trailer. The lower layer encapsulates the higher layer’s data behind a header. OSI uses a more generic term to refer to messages, rather than frame, packet, and segment. OSI uses the term protocol data unit (PDU). A PDU represents the bits that include the headers and trailers for that layer, as well as the encapsulated data. For example, an IP pack- et, as shown in Figure 1-14, using OSI terminology, is a PDU, more specifically a Layer 3 PDU (abbreviated L3PDU) because IP is a Layer 3 protocol. OSI simply refers to the Layer x PDU (LxPDU), with x referring to the number of the layer being discussed, as shown in Figure 1-16. 36 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide L#H - Layer # Header L#T - Layer # Trailer L7H Data L6H Data L5H Data L4H Data L3H Data L2H Data L2T L7PDU L6PDU L5PDU L4PDU L3PDU L2PDU Figure 1-16 OSI Encapsulation and Protocol Data Units Chapter Review The “Your Study Plan” element, just before Chapter 1, discusses how you should study and practice the content and skills for each chapter before moving on to the next chapter.

LANs typically connect nearby devices: devices in the same room, in the same building, or in a campus of buildings. In contrast, WANs connect devices that are typically relatively far apart. Together, LANs and WANs create a complete enterprise computer network, working together to do the job of a computer network: delivering data from one device to another. Many types of LANs have existed over the years, but today’s networks use two general types of LANs: Ethernet LANs and wireless LANs. Ethernet LANs happen to use cables for the links between nodes, and because many types of cables use copper wires, Ethernet LANs are often called wired LANs. In comparison, wireless LANs do not use wires or cables, instead using radio waves for the links between nodes. This chapter introduces Ethernet LANs, with more detailed coverage in Parts II and III of this book. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Multicast address Foundation Topics An Overview of LANs The term Ethernet refers to a family of LAN standards that together define the physical and data link layers of the world’s most popular wired LAN technology. The standards, defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), define the cabling, the con- nectors on the ends of the cables, the protocol rules, and everything else required to create an Ethernet LAN. Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 41 2 Typical SOHO LANs To begin, first think about a small office/home office (SOHO) LAN today, specifically a LAN that uses only Ethernet LAN technology. First, the LAN needs a device called an Ethernet LAN switch, which provides many physical ports into which cables can be con- nected. An Ethernet uses Ethernet cables, which is a general reference to any cable that conforms to any of several Ethernet standards. The LAN uses Ethernet cables to connect different Ethernet devices or nodes to one of the switch’s Ethernet ports. Figure 2-1 shows a drawing of a SOHO Ethernet LAN. The figure shows a single LAN switch, five cables, and five other Ethernet nodes: three PCs, a printer, and one network device called a router. (The router connects the LAN to the WAN, in this case to the Internet.) F0/4 To Internet F0/3 F0/2 F0/1 Switch Router Figure 2-1 Typical Small Ethernet-Only SOHO LAN Although Figure 2-1 shows a simple Ethernet LAN, many SOHO Ethernet LANs today combine the router and switch into a single device. Vendors sell consumer-grade integrated networking devices that work as a router and Ethernet switch, as well as doing other func- tions. These devices typically have “router” on the packaging, but many models also have four-port or eight-port Ethernet LAN switch ports built in to the device. Typical SOHO LANs today also support wireless LAN connections. Ethernet defines wired LAN technology only; in other words, Ethernet LANs use cables. However, you can build one LAN that uses both Ethernet LAN technology as well as wireless LAN technology, which is also defined by the IEEE. Wireless LANs, defined by the IEEE using standards that begin with 802.11, use radio waves to send the bits from one node to the next. Most wireless LANs rely on yet another networking device: a wireless LAN access point (AP). The AP acts somewhat like an Ethernet switch, in that all the wireless LAN nodes com- municate with the Ethernet switch by sending and receiving data with the wireless AP. Of course, as a wireless device, the AP does not need Ethernet ports for cables, other than for a single Ethernet link to connect the AP to the Ethernet LAN, as shown in Figure 2-2.

However, most SOHO networks today would use a single device, often labeled as a “wireless router,” that does all these functions. Typical Enterprise LANs Enterprise networks have similar needs compared to a SOHO network, but on a much larger scale. For example, enterprise Ethernet LANs begin with LAN switches installed in a wiring closet behind a locked door on each floor of a building. The electricians install the Ethernet cabling from that wiring closet to cubicles and conference rooms where devices might need to connect to the LAN. At the same time, most enterprises also support wireless LANs in the same space, to allow people to roam around and still work and to support a growing number of devices that do not have an Ethernet LAN interface. Figure 2-3 shows a conceptual view of a typical enterprise LAN in a three-story building. Each floor has an Ethernet LAN switch and a wireless LAN AP. To allow communication between floors, each per-floor switch connects to one centralized distribution switch. For example, PC3 can send data to PC2, but it would first flow through switch SW3 to the first floor to the dis- tribution switch (SWD) and then back up through switch SW2 on the second floor. PC3 Building 3rd Floor 2nd Floor 1st Floor To Rest of Enterprise Network SW3 PC2 SW2 PC1 SW1 SWD Figure 2-3 Single-Building Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 43 2 The figure also shows the typical way to connect a LAN to a WAN using a router. LAN switches and wireless access points work to create the LAN itself. Routers connect to both the LAN and the WAN. To connect to the LAN, the router simply uses an Ethernet LAN interface and an Ethernet cable, as shown on the lower right of Figure 2-3. The rest of this chapter focuses on Ethernet in particular. The Variety of Ethernet Physical Layer Standards The term Ethernet refers to an entire family of standards. Some standards define the specif- ics of how to send data over a particular type of cabling, and at a particular speed. Other standards define protocols, or rules, that the Ethernet nodes must follow to be a part of an Ethernet LAN. All these Ethernet standards come from the IEEE and include the number 802.3 as the beginning part of the standard name. Ethernet supports a large variety of options for physical Ethernet links given its long history over the last 40 or so years. Today, Ethernet includes many standards for different kinds of optical and copper cabling, and for speeds from 10 megabits per second (Mbps) up to 100 gigabits per second (Gbps). The standards also differ as far as the types of cabling and the allowed length of the cabling. The most fundamental cabling choice has to do with the materials used inside the cable for the physical transmission of bits: either copper wires or glass fibers. The use of unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling saves money compared to optical fibers, with Ethernet nodes using the wires inside the cable to send data over electrical circuits. Fiber-optic cabling, the more expensive alternative, allows Ethernet nodes to send light over glass fibers in the center of the cable. Although more expensive, optical cables typically allow longer cabling distances between nodes. To be ready to choose the products to purchase for a new Ethernet LAN, a network engi- neer must know the names and features of the different Ethernet standards supported in Ethernet products. The IEEE defines Ethernet physical layer standards using a couple of naming conventions. The formal name begins with 802.3 followed by some suffix letters. The IEEE also uses more meaningful shortcut names that identify the speed, as well as a clue about whether the cabling is UTP (with a suffix that includes T) or fiber (with a suffix that includes X). Table 2-2 lists a few Ethernet physical layer standards. First, the table lists enough names so that you get a sense of the IEEE naming conventions. It also lists the four most common standards that use UTP cabling, because this book’s discussion of Ethernet focuses mainly on the UTP options. Table 2-2 Examples of Types of Ethernet Speed Common Name Informal IEEE Standard Name Formal IEEE Standard Name Cable Type, Maximum Length 10 Mbps Ethernet 10BASE-T 802.3 Copper, 100 m 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet 100BASE-T 802.3u Copper, 100 m 1000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet 1000BASE-LX 802.3z Fiber, 5000 m 1000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet 1000BASE-T 802.3ab Copper, 100 m 10 Gbps 10 Gig Ethernet 10GBASE-T 802.3an Copper, 100 m 44 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide NOTE Fiber-optic cabling contains long thin strands of fiberglass. The attached Ethernet nodes send light over the glass fiber in the cable, encoding the bits as changes in the light. Consistent Behavior over All Links Using the Ethernet Data Link Layer Although Ethernet includes many physical layer standards, Ethernet acts like a single LAN technology because it uses the same data link layer standard over all types of Ethernet physical links. That standard defines a common Ethernet header and trailer. (As a reminder, the header and trailer are bytes of overhead data that Ethernet uses to do its job of sending data over a LAN.) No matter whether the data flows over a UTP cable or any kind of fiber cable, and no matter the speed, the data-link header and trailer use the same format. While the physical layer standards focus on sending bits over a cable, the Ethernet data-link protocols focus on sending an Ethernet frame from source to destination Ethernet node. From a data-link perspective, nodes build and forward frames. As first defined in Chapter 1, “Introduction to TCP/IP Networking,” the term frame specifically refers to the header and trailer of a data-link protocol, plus the data encapsulated inside that header and trailer. The various Ethernet nodes simply forward the frame, over all the required links, to deliver the frame to the correct destination. Figure 2-4 shows an example of the process. In this case, PC1 sends an Ethernet frame to PC3. The frame travels over a UTP link to Ethernet switch SW1, then over fiber links to Ethernet switches SW2 and SW3, and finally over another UTP link to PC3. Note that the bits actually travel at four different speeds in this example: 10 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 100 Mbps, respectively . 10 Mbps UTP 1 SW1 Eth Data Eth Eth Data Eth1 1 Gbps UTP 1 Gbps Fiber 10 Gbps Fiber 200m 1km 2 SW2 100 Mbps UTP 3 SW3 4 2 3 Figure 2-4 Ethernet LAN Forwards a Data-Link Frame over Many Types of Links So, what is an Ethernet LAN? It is a combination of user devices, LAN switches, and dif- ferent kinds of cabling. Each link can use different types of cables, at different speeds. However, they all work together to deliver Ethernet frames from the one device on the LAN to some other device. The rest of this chapter takes these concepts a little deeper, first looking at the details of building the physical Ethernet network, followed by some discussion of the rules for forwarding frames through an Ethernet LAN . Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 45 2 Building Physical Ethernet Networks with UTP For this second of three major sections of this chapter, I focus on the individual physical links between any two Ethernet nodes. Before the Ethernet network as a whole can send Ethernet frames between user devices, each node must be ready and able to send data over an individual physical link. This section looks at some of the particulars of how Ethernet sends data over these links. This section focuses on the three most commonly used Ethernet standards: 10BASE-T (Ethernet), 100BASE-T (Fast Ethernet, or FE), and 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet, or GE). Specifically, this section looks at the details of sending data in both directions over a UTP cable. It then examines the specific wiring of the UTP cables used for 10-Mbps, 100-Mbps, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet. Transmitting Data Using Twisted Pairs While it is true that Ethernet sends data over UTP cables, the physical means to send the data uses electricity that flows over the wires inside the UTP cable. To better understand how Ethernet sends data using electricity, break the idea down into two parts: how to create an electrical circuit and then how to make that electrical signal communicate 1s and 0s. First, to create one electrical circuit, Ethernet defines how to use the two wires inside a single twisted pair of wires, as shown in Figure 2-5. The figure does not show a UTP cable between two nodes, but instead shows two individual wires that are inside the UTP cable. An electrical circuit requires a complete loop, so the two nodes, using circuitry on their Ethernet ports, connect the wires in one pair to complete a loop, allowing electricity to flow. Node 1 Node 2 Transmitter Electrical Current One Wire in a Pair Receiver Other Wire, Same Pair Figure 2-5 Creating One Electrical Circuit over One Pair to Send in One Direction To send data, the two devices follow some rules called an encoding scheme. The idea works a lot like when two people talk using the same language: The speaker says some words in a particular language, and the listener, because she speaks the same language, can understand the spoken words. With an encoding scheme, the transmitting node changes the electrical signal over time, while the other node, the receiver, using the same rules, interprets those changes as either 0s or 1s. (For example, 10BASE-T uses an encoding scheme that encodes a binary 0 as a transition from higher voltage to lower voltage during the middle of a 1/10,000,000th-of-a-second interval.) Note that in an actual UTP cable, the wires will be twisted together, instead of being parallel as shown in Figure 2-5. The twisting helps solve some important physical transmission issues. When electrical current passes over any wire, it creates electromagnetic interference (EMI) 46 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide that interferes with the electrical signals in nearby wires, including the wires in the same cable. (EMI between wire pairs in the same cable is called crosstalk.) Twisting the wire pairs together helps cancel out most of the EMI, so most networking physical links that use copper wires use twisted pairs. Breaking Down a UTP Ethernet Link The term Ethernet link refers to any physical cable between two Ethernet nodes. To learn about how a UTP Ethernet link works, it helps to break down the physical link into those basic pieces, as shown in Figure 2-6: the cable itself, the connectors on the ends of the cable, and the matching ports on the devices into which the connectors will be inserted. Node Node Cable with Wires Inside RJ-45 Connectors RJ-45 Port RJ-45 Port Figure 2-6 Basic Components of an Ethernet Link First, think about the UTP cable itself. The cable holds some copper wires, grouped as twisted pairs. The 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T standards require two pairs of wires, while the 1000BASE-T standard requires four pairs. Each wire has a color-coded plastic coating, with the wires in a pair having a color scheme. For example, for the blue wire pair, one wire’s coating is all blue, while the other wire’s coating is blue-and-white striped. Many Ethernet UTP cables use an RJ-45 connector on both ends. The RJ-45 connector has eight physical locations into which the eight wires in the cable can be inserted, called pin positions, or simply pins. These pins create a place where the ends of the copper wires can touch the electronics inside the nodes at the end of the physical link so that electricity can flow. NOTE If available, find a nearby Ethernet UTP cable and examine the connectors closely. Look for the pin positions and the colors of the wires in the connector. To complete the physical link, the nodes each need an RJ-45 Ethernet port that matches the RJ-45 connectors on the cable so that the connectors on the ends of the cable can con- nect to each node. PCs often include this RJ-45 Ethernet port as part of a network interface card (NIC), which can be an expansion card on the PC or can be built in to the system itself. Switches typically have many RJ-45 ports because switches give user devices a place to con- nect to the Ethernet LAN. Figure 2-7 shows photos of the cables, connectors, and ports. Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 47 2 RJ-45 Ports RJ-45 Connector Figure 2-7 RJ-45 Connectors and Ports (Ethernet NIC © Mark Jansen, LAN Cable © Mikko Pitkänen) NOTE The RJ-45 connector is slightly wider, but otherwise similar, to the RJ-11 connec- tors commonly used for telephone cables in homes in North America. The figure shows a connector on the left and ports on the right. The left shows the eight pin positions in the end of the RJ-45 connector. The upper right shows an Ethernet NIC that is not yet installed in a computer. The lower-right part of the figure shows the side of a Cisco 2960 switch, with multiple RJ-45 ports, allowing multiple devices to easily connect to the Ethernet network. Finally, while RJ-45 connectors with UTP cabling can be common, Cisco LAN switches often support other types of connectors as well. When you buy one of the many models of Cisco switches, you need to think about the mix and numbers of each type of physical ports you want on the switch. To give its customers flexibility as to the type of Ethernet links, even after the customer has bought the switch, Cisco switches include some physical ports whose port hardware (the transceiver) can be changed later, after you purchase the switch. For example, Figure 2-8 shows a photo of a Cisco switch with one of the swappable trans- ceivers. In this case, the figure shows an enhanced small form-factor pluggable (SFP+) trans- ceiver, which runs at 10 Gbps, just outside two SFP+ slots on a Cisco 3560CX switch. The SFP+ itself is the silver colored part below the switch, with a black cable connected to it. 48 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Cable SFP+ Figure 2-8 10Gbps SFP+ with Cable Sitting Just Outside a Catalyst 3560CX Switch UTP Cabling Pinouts for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T So far in this section, you have learned about the equivalent of how to drive a truck on a 1000- acre ranch, but you do not know the equivalent of the local traffic rules. If you worked the ranch, you could drive the truck all over the ranch, any place you wanted to go, and the police would not mind. However, as soon as you get on the public roads, the police want you to behave and follow the rules. Similarly, so far this chapter has discussed the general principles of how to send data, but it has not yet detailed some important rules for Ethernet cabling: the rules of the road so that all the devices send data using the right wires inside the cable. This next topic discusses conventions for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T together, because they use UTP cabling in similar ways (including the use of only two wire pairs). A short compari- son of the wiring for 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet), which uses four pairs, follows. Straight-Through Cable Pinout 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T use two pairs of wires in a UTP cable, one for each direction, as shown in Figure 2-9. The figure shows four wires, all of which sit inside a single UTP cable that connects a PC and a LAN switch. In this example, the PC on the left transmits using the top pair, and the switch on the right transmits using the bottom pair. PC Switch Receiver Data Flow One Twisted Pair Transmitter Transmitter Data Flow One Twisted Pair1 1 2 2 3 3 6 6 Receiver Figure 2-9 Using One Pair for Each Transmission Direction with 10- and 100-Mbps Ethernet Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 49 2 For correct transmission over the link, the wires in the UTP cable must be connected to the correct pin positions in the RJ-45 connectors. For example, in Figure 2-9, the transmitter on the PC on the left must know the pin positions of the two wires it should use to trans- mit. Those two wires must be connected to the correct pins in the RJ-45 connector on the switch, so that the switch’s receiver logic can use the correct wires. To understand the wiring of the cable—which wires need to be in which pin positions on both ends of the cable—you need to first understand how the NICs and switches work. As a rule, Ethernet NIC transmitters use the pair connected to pins 1 and 2; the NIC receivers use a pair of wires at pin positions 3 and 6. LAN switches, knowing those facts about what Ethernet NICs do, do the opposite: Their receivers use the wire pair at pins 1 and 2, and their transmitters use the wire pair at pins 3 and 6. To allow a PC NIC to communicate with a switch, the UTP cable must also use a straight- through cable pinout. The term pinout refers to the wiring of which color wire is placed in each of the eight numbered pin positions in the RJ-45 connector. An Ethernet straight- through cable connects the wire at pin 1 on one end of the cable to pin 1 at the other end of the cable; the wire at pin 2 needs to connect to pin 2 on the other end of the cable; pin 3 on one end connects to pin 3 on the other, and so on. Also, it uses the wires in one wire pair at pins 1 and 2, and another pair at pins 3 and 6.

In this case, PC Larry connects to a LAN switch. Note that the figure again does not show the UTP cable, but instead shows the wires that sit inside the cable, to emphasize the idea of wire pairs and pins. Larry Switch (1,2) (1,2) Straight-Through Cable NIC (3,6) (3,6) Figure 2-11 Ethernet Straight-Through Cable Concept 50 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide A straight-through cable works correctly when the nodes use opposite pairs for transmit- ting data. However, when two like devices connect to an Ethernet link, they both transmit on the same pins. In that case, you then need another type of cabling pinout called a cross- over cable. The crossover cable pinout crosses the pair at the transmit pins on each device to the receive pins on the opposite device. While that previous sentence is true, this concept is much clearer with a figure such as Figure 2-12. The figure shows what happens on a link between two switches. The two switches both transmit on the pair at pins 3 and 6, and they both receive on the pair at pins 1 and 2. So, the cable must connect a pair at pins 3 and 6 on each side to pins 1 and 2 on the other side, connecting to the other node’s receiver logic. The top of the figure shows the literal pinouts, and the bo ttom half shows a conceptual diagram.

The key is to know whether a device acts like a PC NIC, transmitting at pins 1 and 2, or like a switch, transmitting at pins 3 and 6. Then, just apply the following logic: Crossover cable: If the endpoints transmit on the same pin pair Straight-through cable: If the endpoints transmit on different pin pairs Table 2-3 lists the devices and the pin pairs they use, assuming that they use 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T. Table 2-3 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T Pin Pairs Used Transmits on Pins 1,2 Transmits on Pins 3,6 PC NICs Hubs Routers Switches Wireless access point (Ethernet interface) — For example, Figure 2-13 shows a campus LAN in a single building. In this case, several straight-through cables are used to connect PCs to switches. In addition, the cables connect- ing the switches require crossover cables. Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 51 2 Building 1 Straight- through Cables Building 2 Straight- through Cables Crossover Cables Switch 11 Switch 12 Switch 21 Switch 22 Figure 2-13 Typical Uses for Straight-Through and Crossover Ethernet Cables NOTE If you have some experience with installing LANs, you might be thinking that you have used the wrong cable before (straight-through or crossover) but the cable worked. Cisco switches have a feature called auto-mdix that notices when the wrong cable is used and automatically changes its logic to make the link work. However, for the exams, be ready to identify whether the correct cable is shown in the figures. UTP Cabling Pinouts for 1000BASE-T 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet) differs from 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T as far as the cabling and pinouts. First, 1000BASE-T requires four wire pairs. Second, it uses more advanced electronics that allow both ends to transmit and receive simultaneously on each wire pair. However, the wiring pinouts for 1000BASE-T work almost identically to the earlier stan- dards, adding details for the additional two pairs. The straight-through cable connects each pin with the same numbered pin on the other side, but it does so for all eight pins—pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, up through pin 8. It keeps one pair at pins 1 and 2 and another at pins 3 and 6, just like in the earlier wiring. It adds a pair at pins 4 and 5 and the final pair at pins 7 and 8 (refer to Figure 2-10). The Gigabit Ethernet crossover cable crosses the same two-wire pairs as the crossover cable for the other types of Ethernet (the pairs at pins 1,2 and 3,6). It also crosses the two new pairs as well (the pair at pins 4,5 with the pair at pins 7 ,8). Sending Data in Ethernet Networks Although physical layer standards vary quite a bit, other parts of the Ethernet standards work the same way, regardless of the type of physical Ethernet link. Next, this final major section of this chapter looks at several protocols and rules that Ethernet uses regardless of the type of link. In particular, this section examines the details of the Ethernet data link layer protocol, plus how Ethernet nodes, switches, and hubs forward Ethernet frames through an Ethernet LAN. Ethernet Data-Link Protocols One of the most significant strengths of the Ethernet family of protocols is that these pro- tocols use the same data-link standard. In fact, the core parts of the data-link standard date back to the original Ethernet standards. 52 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The Ethernet data-link protocol defines the Ethernet frame: an Ethernet header at the front, the encapsulated data in the middle, and an Ethernet trailer at the end. Ethernet actually defines a few alternate formats for the header, with the frame format shown in Figure 2-14 being commonly used today. Preamble 7 SFD 1 Destination Header Trailer Bytes 6 Source 6 Type 2 Data and Pad 46 – 1500 FCS 4 Figure 2-14 Commonly Used Ethernet Frame Format While all the fields in the frame matter, some matter more to the topics discussed in this book. Table 2-4 lists the fields in the header and trailer and a brief description for reference, with the upcoming pages including more detail about a few of these fields. Table 2-4 IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Header and Trailer Fields Field Bytes Description Preamble 7 Synchronization. Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) 1 Signifies that the next byte begins the Destination MAC Address field. Destination MAC Address 6 Identifies the intended recipient of this frame. Source MAC Address 6 Identifies the sender of this frame. Type 2 Defines the type of protocol listed inside the frame; today, most likely identifies IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6). Data and Pad* 46– 1500 Holds data from a higher layer, typically an L3PDU (usually an IPv4 or IPv6 packet). The sender adds padding to meet the minimum length requirement for this field (46 bytes). Frame Check Sequence (FCS) 4 Provides a method for the receiving NIC to determine whether the frame experienced transmission errors. * The IEEE 802.3 specifi cation limits the data portion of the 802.3 frame to a minimum of 46 and a maximum of 1500 bytes. The term maximum transmission unit (MTU) defi nes the maximum Layer 3 packet that can be sent over a medium. Because the Layer 3 packet rests inside the data portion of an Ethernet frame, 1500 bytes is the largest IP MTU allowed over an Ethernet . Ethernet Addressing The source and destination Ethernet address fields play a huge role in how Ethernet LANs work. The general idea for each is relatively simple: The sending node puts its own address in the source address field and the intended Ethernet destination device’s address in the des- tination address field. The sender transmits the frame, expecting that the Ethernet LAN, as a whole, will deliver the frame to that correct destination. Ethernet addresses, also called Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, are 6-byte-long (48-bit- long) binary numbers. For convenience, most computers list MAC addresses as 12-digit hexa- decimal numbers. Cisco devices typically add some periods to the number for easier readabil- ity as well; for example, a Cisco switch might list a MAC address as 0000.0C12.3456. Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 53 2 Most MAC addresses represent a single NIC or other Ethernet port, so these addresses are often called a unicast Ethernet address. The term unicast is simply a formal way to refer to the fact that the address represents one interface to the Ethernet LAN. (This term also con- trasts with two other types of Ethernet addresses, broadcast and multicast, which will be defined later in this section.) The entire idea of sending data to a destination unicast MAC address works well, but it works only if all the unicast MAC addresses are unique. If two NICs tried to use the same MAC address, there could be confusion. (The problem would be like the confusion caused to the postal service if you and I both tried to use the same mailing address—would the postal service deliver mail to your house or mine?) If two PCs on the same Ethernet tried to use the same MAC address, to which PC should frames sent to that MAC address be delivered? Ethernet solves this problem using an administrative process so that, at the time of manufacture, all Ethernet devices are assigned a universally unique MAC address. Before a manufacturer can build Ethernet products, it must ask the IEEE to assign the manu- facturer a universally unique 3-byte code, called the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). The manufacturer agrees to give all NICs (and other Ethernet products) a MAC address that begins with its assigned 3-byte OUI. The manufacturer also assigns a unique value for the last 3 bytes, a number that manufacturer has never used with that OUI. As a result, the MAC address of every device in the universe is unique. NOTE The IEEE also calls these universal MAC addresses global MAC addresses. Figure 2-15 shows the structure of the unicast MAC address, with the OUI. 24 Bits 24 Bits 6 Hex Digits 6 Hex Digits 00 60 2F 3A 07 BC Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) Vendor Assigned (NIC Cards, Interfaces) Size, in bits Size, in hex digits Example Figure 2-15 Structure of Unicast Ethernet Addresses Ethernet addresses go by many names: LAN address, Ethernet address, hardware address, burned-in address, physical address, universal address, or MAC address. For example, the term burned-in address (BIA) refers to the idea that a permanent MAC address has been encoded (burned into) the ROM chip on the NIC. As another example, the IEEE uses the term universal address to emphasize the fact that the address assigned to a NIC by a manu- facturer should be unique among all MAC addresses in the universe. In addition to unicast addresses, Ethernet also uses group addresses. Group addresses iden- tify more than one LAN interface card. A frame sent to a group address might be delivered to a small set of devices on the LAN, or even to all devices on the LAN. In fact, the IEEE defines two general categories of group addresses for Ethernet: 54 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Broadcast address: Frames sent to this address should be delivered to all devices on the Ethernet LAN. It has a value of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. Multicast addresses: Frames sent to a multicast Ethernet address will be copied and for- warded to a subset of the devices on the LAN that volunteers to receive frames sent to a specific multicast address. Table 2-5 summarizes most of the details about MAC addresses. Table 2-5 LAN MAC Address Terminology and Features LAN Addressing Term or Feature Description MAC Media Access Control. 802.3 (Ethernet) defines the MAC sublayer of IEEE Ethernet. Ethernet address, NIC address, LAN address Other names often used instead of MAC address. These terms describe the 6-byte address of the LAN interface card. Burned-in address The 6-byte address assigned by the vendor making the card. Unicast address A term for a MAC address that represents a single LAN interface. Broadcast address An address that means “all devices that reside on this LAN right now.” Multicast address On Ethernet, a multicast address implies some subset of all devices currently on the Ethernet LAN. Identifying Network Layer Protocols with the Ethernet Type Field While the Ethernet header’s address fields play an important and more obvious role in Ethernet LANs, the Ethernet Type field plays a much less obvious role. The Ethernet Type field, or EtherType, sits in the Ethernet data link layer header, but its purpose is to directly help the network processing on routers and hosts. Basically, the Type field identifies the type of network layer (Layer 3) packet that sits inside the Ethernet frame. First, think about what sits inside the data part of the Ethernet frame shown earlier in Figure 2-14. Typically, it holds the network layer packet created by the network layer protocol on some device in the network. Over the years, those protocols have included IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Novell NetWare, Digital Equipment Corporation’s DECnet, and Apple Computer’s AppleTalk. Today, the most common network layer protocols are both from TCP/IP: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6). The original host has a place to insert a value (a hexadecimal number) to identify the type of packet encapsulated inside the Ethernet frame. However, what number should the sender put in the header to identify an IPv4 packet as the type? Or an IPv6 packet? As it turns out, the IEEE manages a list of EtherType values, so that every network layer protocol that needs a unique EtherType value can have a number. The sender just has to know the list. (Anyone can view the list; just go to www.ieee.org and search for EtherType.) For example, a host can send one Ethernet frame with an IPv4 packet and the next Ethernet frame with an IPv6 packet. Each frame would have a different Ethernet Type field value, using the values reserved by the IEEE, as shown in Figure 2-16. http://www.ieee.org Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 55 2 Eth Header IPv4 Type = 0800 Eth Trailer Eth Header IPv6 Type = 86DD Eth Trailer R1SW1 Figure 2-16 Use of Ethernet Type Field Error Detection with FCS Ethernet also defines a way for nodes to find out whether a frame’s bits changed while crossing over an Ethernet link. (Usually, the bits could change because of some kind of elec- trical interference, or a bad NIC.) Ethernet, like most data-link protocols, uses a field in the data-link trailer for the purpose of error detection. The Ethernet Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field in the Ethernet trailer—the only field in the Ethernet trailer—gives the receiving node a way to compare results with the sender, to discover whether errors occurred in the frame. The sender applies a complex math formula to the frame before sending it, storing the result of the formula in the FCS field. The receiv- er applies the same math formula to the received frame. The receiver then compares its own results with the sender’s results. If the results are the same, the frame did not change; other- wise, an error occurred and the receiver discards the frame. Note that error detection does not also mean error recovery. Ethernet defines that the errored frame should be discarded, but Ethernet does not attempt to recover the lost frame. Other protocols, notably TCP, recover the lost data by noticing that it is lost and sending the data again. Sending Ethernet Frames with Switches and Hubs Ethernet LANs behave slightly differently depending on whether the LAN has mostly mod- ern devices, in particular, LAN switches instead of some older LAN devices called LAN hubs. Basically, the use of more modern switches allows the use of full-duplex logic, which is much faster and simpler than half-duplex logic, which is required when using hubs. The final topic in this chapter looks at these basic differences. Sending in Modern Ethernet LANs Using Full Duplex Modern Ethernet LANs use a variety of Ethernet physical standards, but with standard Ethernet frames that can flow over any of these types of physical links. Each individual link can run at a different speed, but each link allows the attached nodes to send the bits in the frame to the next node. They must work together to deliver the data from the sending Ethernet node to the destination node. The process is relatively simple, on purpose; the simplicity lets each device send a large number of frames per second. Figure 2-17 shows an example in which PC1 sends an Ethernet frame to PC2. 56 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Full 1000Base-TG0/1 Source = PC1 Dest = PC2 10BASE-T Full 2 1 3 DataEth Eth 4 DataEth Eth 100BASE-T Full F0/2 1 2 SW2SW1 Figure 2-17 Example of Sending Data in a Modern Ethernet LAN Following the steps in the figure: 1. PC1 builds and sends the original Ethernet frame, using its own MAC address as the source address and PC2’s MAC address as the destination address. 2. Switch SW1 receives and forwards the Ethernet frame out its G0/1 interface (short for Gigabit interface 0/1) to SW2. 3. Switch SW2 receives and forwards the Ethernet frame out its F0/2 interface (short for Fast Ethernet interface 0/2) to PC2. 4. PC2 receives the frame, recognizes the destination MAC address as its own, and pro- cesses the frame. The Ethernet network in Figure 2-17 uses full duplex on each link, but the concept might be difficult to see. Full-duplex means that that the NIC or switch port has no half-duplex restrictions. So, to understand full duplex, you need to understand half duplex, as follows: Half duplex: The device must wait to send if it is currently receiving a frame; in other words, it cannot send and receive at the same time. Full duplex: The device does not have to wait before sending; it can send and receive at the same time. So, with all PCs and LAN switches, and no LAN hubs, all the nodes can use full duplex. All nodes can send and receive on their port at the same instant in time. For example, in Figure 2-17, PC1 and PC2 could send frames to each other simultaneously, in both directions, without any half-duplex restrictions. Using Half Duplex with LAN Hubs To understand the need for half-duplex logic in some cases, you have to understand a little about an older type of networking device called a LAN hub. When the IEEE first introduced 10BASE-T in 1990, the Ethernet did not yet include LAN switches. Instead of switches, vendors created LAN hubs. The LAN hub provided a number of RJ-45 ports as a place to connect links to PCs, just like a LAN switch, but it used different rules for forward- ing data. Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs 57 2 LAN hubs forward data using physical layer standards, and are therefore considered to be Layer 1 devices. When an electrical signal comes in one hub port, the hub repeats that elec- trical signal out all other ports (except the incoming port). By doing so, the data reaches all the rest of the nodes connected to the hub, so the data hopefully reaches the correct desti- nation. The hub has no concept of Ethernet frames, of addresses, and so on. The downside of using LAN hubs is that if two or more devices transmitted a signal at the same instant, the electrical signal collides and becomes garbled. The hub repeats all received electrical signals, even if it receives multiple signals at the same time. For example, Figure 2-18 shows the idea, with PCs Archie and Bob sending an electrical signal at the same instant of time (at Steps 1A and 1B) and the hub repeating both electrical signals out toward Larry on the left (Step 2). Larry Archie Bob Hub 1 Collision! 1B 1A2 Figure 2-18 Collision Occurring Because of LAN Hub Behavior NOTE For completeness, note that the hub floods each frame out all other ports (except the incoming port). So, Archie’s frame goes to both Larry and Bob; Bob’s frame goes to Larry and Archie. If you replace the hub in Figure 2-18 with a LAN switch, the switch prevents the collision on the left. The switch operates as a Layer 2 device, meaning that it looks at the data-link header and trailer. A switch would look at the MAC addresses, and even if the switch need- ed to forward both frames to Larry on the left, the switch would send one frame and queue the other frame until the first frame was finished. Now back to the issue created by the hub’s logic: collisions. To prevent these collisions, the Ethernet nodes must use half-duplex logic instead of full-duplex logic. A problem occurs only when two or more devices send at the same time; half-duplex logic tells the nodes that if someone else is sending, wait before sending. For example, back in Figure 2-18, imagine that Archie began sending his frame early enough so that Bob received the first bits of that frame before Bob tried to send his own frame. Bob, at Step 1B, would notice that he was receiving a frame from someone else, and using half-duplex logic, would simply wait to send the frame listed at Step 1B. Nodes that use half-duplex logic actually use a relatively well-known algorithm called car- rier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). The algorithm takes care of the obvious cases but also the cases caused by unfortunate timing. For example, two nodes could check for an incoming frame at the exact same instant, both realize that no other node is sending, and both send their frames at the exact same instant, causing a collision. CSMA/CD covers these cases as well, as follows: Step 1. A device with a frame to send listens until the Ethernet is not busy. Step 2. When the Ethernet is not busy, the sender begins sending the frame. 58 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Step 3. The sender listens while sending to discover whether a collision occurs; colli- sions might be caused by many reasons, including unfortunate timing. If a colli- sion occurs, all currently sending nodes do the following: A. They send a jamming signal that tells all nodes that a collision happened. B. They independently choose a random time to wait before trying again, to avoid unfortunate timing. C. The next attempt starts again at Step 1. Although most modern LANs do not often use hubs, and therefore do not need to use half duplex, enough old hubs still exist in enterprise networks so that you need to be ready to understand duplex issues. Each NIC and switch port has a duplex setting. For all links between PCs and switches, or between switches, use full duplex. However, for any link connected to a LAN hub, the connected LAN switch and NIC port should use half-duplex. Note that the hub itself does not use half-duplex logic, instead just repeating incoming sig- nals out every other port. Figure 2-19 shows an example, with full-duplex links on the left and a single LAN hub on the right. The hub then requires SW2’s F0/2 interface to use half-duplex logic, along with the PCs connected to the hub.

Because both WANs and LANs match OSI Layers 1 and 2, they have many similarities: Both define cabling details, transmission speeds, encoding, and how to send data over physical links, as well as data-link frames and forwarding logic. Of course, WANs and LANs have many differences as well, most notably the distances between nodes and the business model for paying for the network. First, in terms of the dis- tance, the terms local and wide give us a small hint: LANs typically include nearby devices, whereas WANs connect devices that can be far apart, potentially hundreds or thousands of miles apart. The other big difference between the two is this: You pay for and own LANs, but you lease WANs. With LANs, you buy the cables and LAN switches and install them in spaces you control. WANs physically pass through other people’s property, and you do not have the right to put your cables and devices there. So, a few companies, like a telephone company or cable company, install and own their own devices and cables, creating their own net- works, and lease the right to send data over their networks. This chapter introduces WANs in three major sections. The first introduces leased line WANs, a type of WAN link that has been part of enterprise networks since the 1960s. The second part shows how Ethernet can be used to create WAN services by taking advantage of the longer cable length possibilities of modern fiber-optic Ethernet standards. The last part of the chapter takes a survey of common WAN technology used to access the Internet. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Foundation Topics Leased-Line WANs Imagine that you are the primary network engineer for an enterprise TCP/IP internetwork. Your company is building a new building at a site 100 miles away from your corporate head- quarters. You will of course install a LAN throughout the new building, but you also need to connect that new remote LAN to the rest of the existing enterprise TCP/IP network. To connect the new building’s LAN to the rest of the existing corporate network, you need some kind of a WAN. At a minimum, that WAN must be able to send data from the remote LAN back to the rest of the existing network and vice versa. Leased line WANs do exactly that, forwarding data between two routers. From a basic point of view, a leased line WAN works a lot like an Ethernet crossover cable connecting two routers, but with few distance limitations. Each router can send at any time (full duplex) over the leased line, for tens, hundreds, or even thousands of miles. This section begins by giving some perspective about where leased lines fit with LANs and routers, because one main goal for a WAN is to move data between LANs. The rest of this first section explains the physical details about leased lines, followed with information about data-link protocols . Positioning Leased Lines with LANs and Routers The vast majority of end-user devices in an enterprise or small office/home office (SOHO) network connect directly into a LAN. Many PCs use an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) that connects to a switch. More and more, devices use 802.11 wireless LANs, with some devices like phones and tablets supporting only wireless LAN connections. Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs 63 3 Now think about a typical company that has many different locations. From a human resources perspective, it might have lots of employees that work at many locations. From a facilities perspective, the company might have a few large sites, with hundreds or even thousands of individual branch offices, stores, or other small locations. However, from a networking perspective, think of each site as being one or more LANs that need to com- municate with each other, and to communicate, those LANs need to be connected to each other using a WAN. To connect LANs using a WAN, the internetwork uses a router connected to each LAN, with a WAN link between the routers. First, the enterprise’s network engineer would order some kind of WAN link. A router at each site connects to both the WAN link and the LAN, as shown in Figure 3-1. Note that a crooked line between the routers is the common way to represent a leased line when the drawing does not need to show any of the physical details of the line. PC1 LAN WAN LAN PC2 R1 R2 Figure 3-1 Small Enterprise Network with One Leased Line The world of WAN technologies includes many different options in addition to the leased line shown in the figure. WAN technology includes a large number of options for physical links, as well as the data-link protocols that control those links. By comparison, the wired LAN world basically has one major option today—Ethernet—because Ethernet won the wired LAN battle in the marketplace back in the 1980s and 1990s. Physical Details of Leased Lines The leased line service delivers bits in both directions, at a predetermined speed, using full- duplex logic. In fact, conceptually it acts as if you had a full-duplex crossover Ethernet link between two routers, as shown in Figure 3-2. The leased line uses two pairs of wires, one pair for each direction of sending data, which allows full-duplex operation. Building 1 1000 Miles Building 2 R2R1 SW11 SW12 SW21 SW22 Figure 3-2 Conceptual View of the Leased-Line Service Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 B 2 C 3 B 4 B and D 5 B and C 6 C 64 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Of course, leased lines have many differences compared to an Ethernet crossover cable. To create such possibly long links, or circuits, a leased line does not actually exist as a single long cable between the two sites. Instead, the telco installs a large network of cables and specialized switching devices to create its own computer network. The telco network cre- ates a service that acts like a crossover cable between two points, but the physical reality is hidden from the customer. Leased lines come with their own set of terminology as well. First, the term leased line refers to the fact that the company using the leased line does not own the line, but instead pays a monthly lease fee to use it. However, many people today use the generic term ser- vice provider to refer to a company that provides any form of WAN connectivity, includ- ing Internet services. Given their long history, leased lines have had many names. Table 3-2 lists some of those names, mainly so that in a networking job, you have a chance to translate from the terms each person uses with a basic description as to the meaning of the name. Table 3-2 Different Names for a Leased Line Name Meaning or Reference Leased circuit, Circuit The words line and circuit are often used as synonyms in telco terminology; circuit makes reference to the electrical circuit between the two endpoints. Serial link, Serial line The words link and line are also often used as synonyms. Serial in this case refers to the fact that the bits flow serially, and that routers use serial interfaces. Point-to-point link, Point-to-point line Refers to the fact that the topology stretches between two points, and two points only. (Some older leased lines allowed more than two devices.) T1 A specific type of leased line that transmits data at 1.544 megabits per second (1.544 Mbps). WAN link, Link Both these terms are very general, with no reference to any specific technology. Private line Refers to the fact that the data sent over the line cannot be copied by other telco customers, so the data is private. Leased-Line Cabling To create a leased line, some physical path must exist between the two routers on the ends of the link. The physical cabling must leave the buildings where each router sits. However, the telco does not simply install one cable between the two buildings. Instead, it uses what is typically a large and complex network that creates the appearance of a cable between the two routers. Figure 3-3 gives a little insight into the cabling that could exist inside the telco for a short leased line. Telcos put their equipment in buildings called central offices (CO). The telco installs cables from the CO to most every other building in the city, expecting to sell ser- vices to the people in those buildings one day. The telco would then configure its switches to use some of the capacity on each cable to send data in both directions, creating the equivalent of a crossover cable between the two routers. Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs 65 3 Customer Site1 Underground Telco CO1 Telco CO2 Customer Site2 R1 R2Switch-2Switch-1 Figure 3-3 Possible Cabling Inside a Telco for a Short Leased Line Although what happens inside the telco is completely hidden from the telco customer, enterprise engineers do need to know about the parts of the link that exist inside the cus- tomer’s building at the router . First, each site has customer premises equipment (CPE), which includes the router, serial interface card, and CSU/DSU. Each router uses a serial interface card that acts somewhat like an Ethernet NIC, sending and receiving data over the physical link. The physical link requires a function called a channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU). The CSU/DSU can either be integrated into the serial interface card in the router or sit outside the router as an external device. Figure 3-4 shows the CPE devices, along with the cabling. CSU CSU TELCO CPE CPE Short Cables (Usually Less Than 50 Feet) Long Cables (Can Be Several Miles Long) R1 R2 Figure 3-4 Point-to-Point Leased Line: Components and Terminology The cabling includes a short serial cable (only if an external CSU/DSU is used) plus the cable installed by the telco for the leased line itself. The serial cable connects the router serial interface to the external CSU/DSU. (Many cable options exist; the cable just needs to match the connector of the serial interface on one end and the CSU/DSU on the other end.) The four-wire cable from the telco plugs in to the CSU/DSU, typically using an RJ-48 connector that has the same size and shape as an RJ-45 connector (as shown in Figure 2-7 in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs”). Telcos offer a wide variety of speeds for leased lines. However, you cannot pick the exact speed you want; instead, you must pick from a long list of predefined speeds. Slower-speed links run at multiples of 64 kbps (kilobits per second), while faster links run at multiples of about 1.5 Mbps (megabits per second). Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs 67 3 Because leased lines define only the Layer 1 transmission service, many companies and stan- dards organizations have created data-link protocols to control and use leased lines. Today, the two most popular data link layer protocols used for leased lines between two routers are High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). This next topic takes a brief look at HDLC, just to show one example, plus a few comments about how routers use WAN data-link protocols. HDLC Basics All data-link protocols perform a similar role: to control the correct delivery of data over a physical link of a particular type. For example, the Ethernet data-link protocol uses a desti- nation address field to identify the correct device that should receive the data, and an FCS field that allows the receiving device to determine whether the data arrived correctly. HDLC provides similar functions. HDLC has less work to do because of the simple point-to-point topology of a point-to- point leased line. When one router sends an HDLC frame, it can go only one place: to the other end of the link. So, while HDLC has an address field, the destination is implied. The idea is sort of like when I have lunch with my friend Gary, and only Gary. I do not need to start every sentence with “Hey Gary”—he knows I am talking to him. NOTE In case you wonder why HDLC has an address field at all, in years past, the telcos offered multidrop circuits. These circuits included more than two devices, so there was more than one possible destination, requiring an address field to identify the correct destination. HDLC has other fields and functions similar to Ethernet as well. Table 3-3 lists the HDLC fields, with the similar Ethernet header/trailer field, just for the sake of learning HDLC based on something you have already learned about (Ethernet ). Table 3-3 Comparing HDLC Header Fields to Ethernet HDLC Field Ethernet Equivalent Description Flag Preamble, SFD Lists a recognizable bit pattern so that the receiving nodes realize that a new frame is arriving. Address Destination Address Identifies the destination device. Control N/A Mostly used for purposes no longer in use today for links between routers. Type Type Identifies the type of Layer 3 packet encapsulated inside the frame. FCS FCS A field used by the error detection process. (It is the only trailer field in this table. ) HDLC exists today as a standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the same organization that brought us the OSI model. However, ISO standard HDLC does not have a Type field, and routers need to know the type of packet inside the frame. So, Cisco routers use a Cisco-proprietary variation of HDLC that adds a Type field, as shown in Figure 3-6. 68 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Proprietary Cisco HDLC (Adds Type Field) Bytes 1 11 2 Variable 2 Flag Address Control Data FCS Type Figure 3-6 HDLC Framing How Routers Use a WAN Data Link Today, most leased lines connect to routers, and routers focus on delivering packets to a destination host. However, routers physically connect to both LANs and WANs, with those LANs and WANs requiring that data be sent inside data-link frames. So, now that you know a little about HDLC, it helps to think about how routers use the HDLC protocol when send- ing data. First, the TCP/IP network layer focuses on forwarding IP packets from the sending host to the destination host. The underlying LANs and WANs just act as a way to move the packets to the next router or end-user device. Figure 3-7 shows that network layer perspective. PC2PC1 WAN LANLAN1 2 3 Final Destination PC2? Send to R1 Next Final Destination PC2? Send to R2 Next Final Destination PC2? Send to PC2 Next To PC2 To PC2 To PC2 R1 R2 Figure 3-7 IP Routing Logic over LANs and WANs Following the steps in the figure, for a packet sent by PC1 to PC2’s IP address: 1. PC1’s network layer (IP) logic tells it to send the packet to a nearby router (R1). 2. Router R1’s network layer logic tells it to forward (route) the packet out the leased line to Router R2 next. 3. Router R2’s network layer logic tells it to forward (route) the packet out the LAN link to PC2 next. While Figure 3-7 shows the network layer logic, the PCs and routers must rely on the LANs and WANs in the figure to actually move the bits in the packet. Figure 3-8 shows the same figure, with the same packet, but this time showing some of the data link layer logic used by the hosts and routers. Basically, three separate data link layer steps encapsulate the packet, inside a data-link frame, over three hops through the internetwork: from PC1 to R1, from R1 to R2, and from R2 to PC2.

To send the IP packet to Router R1 next, PC1 encapsulates the IP packet in an Ethernet frame that has the destination MAC address of R1. 2. Router R1 de-encapsulates (removes) the IP packet from the Ethernet frame, encapsu- lates the packet into an HDLC frame using an HDLC header and trailer, and forwards the HDLC frame to Router R2 next. 3. Router R2 de-encapsulates (removes) the IP packet from the HDLC frame, encapsu- lates the packet into an Ethernet frame that has the destination MAC address of PC2, and forwards the Ethernet frame to PC2. In summary, a leased line with HDLC creates a WAN link between two routers so that they can forward packets for the devices on the attached LANs. The leased line itself provides the physical means to transmit the bits, in both directions. The HDLC frames provide the means to encapsulate the network layer packet correctly so that it crosses the link between routers. Leased lines have many benefits that have led to their relatively long life in the WAN mar- ketplace. These lines are simple for the customer, are widely available, are of high quality, and are private. However, they do have some negatives as well compared to newer WAN technologies, including a higher cost and typically longer lead times to get the service installed. The next section looks at an alternative WAN technology used in some examples in this book: Ethernet. Ethernet as a WAN Technology For the first several decades of the existence of Ethernet, Ethernet was only appropriate for LANs. The restrictions on cable lengths and devices might allow a LAN that stretched a kilometer or two, to support a campus LAN, but that was the limit. As time passed, the IEEE improved Ethernet standards in ways that made Ethernet a reason- able WAN technology. For example, the 1000BASE-LX standard uses single-mode fiber cabling, with support for a 5-km cable length; the 1000BASE-ZX standard supports an even longer 70-km cable length. As time went by, and as the IEEE improved cabling distances for fiber Ethernet links, Ethernet became a reasonable WAN technology. Today, in this second decade of the twenty-first century, many WAN service providers (SP) offer WAN services that take advantage of Ethernet. SPs offer a wide variety of these Ethernet WAN services, with many different names. But all of them use a similar model, with Ethernet used between the customer site and the SP’s network, as shown in Figure 3-9. 70 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Fiber Ethernet Access Link 6HUYLFH�3URYLGHU·V Ethernet WAN Service R1 R2SP1 SP2 Service Provider PoP Service Provider PoP Customer Site Customer Site Fiber Ethernet Access Link CPE CPE Figure 3-9 Fiber Ethernet Link to Connect a CPE Router to a Service Provider’s WAN The model shown in Figure 3-9 has many of the same ideas of how a telco creates a leased line, as shown earlier in Figure 3-3, but now with Ethernet links and devices. The customer connects to an Ethernet link using a router interface. The (fiber) Ethernet link leaves the customer building and connects to some nearby SP location called a point of presence (PoP). Instead of a telco switch as shown in Figure 3-3, the SP uses an Ethernet switch. Inside the SP’s network, the SP uses any technology that it wants to create the specific Ethernet WAN services. Ethernet WANs that Create a Layer 2 Service The WAN services implied by Figure 3-9 include a broad number of services, with a lot of complex networking concepts needed to understand those services. Yet, we sit here at the third chapter of what is probably your first Cisco certification book, so clearly, getting into depth on these WAN services makes little sense. So, this book focuses on one specific Ethernet WAN service that can be easily understood if you understand how Ethernet LANs work. NOTE For perspective about the broad world of the service provider network shown in Figure 3-9, look for more information about the Cisco CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE Service Provider certifications. See www.cisco.com/go/certifications for more details. The one Ethernet WAN service goes by two names: Ethernet emulation and Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS). Ethernet emulation is a general term, meaning that the service acts like one Ethernet link. EoMPLS refers to Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), which is one technology that can be used inside the SP’s cloud. This book will refer to this specific ser- vice either as Ethernet emulation or EoMPLS. The type of EoMPLS service discussed in this book gives the customer an Ethernet link between two sites. In other words, the EoMPLS service provides ■ A point-to-point connection between two customer devices ■ Behavior as if a fiber Ethernet link existed between the two devices So, if you can imagine two routers, with a single Ethernet link between the two routers, you understand what this particular EoMPLS service does. http://www.cisco.com/go/certifications Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs 71 3 Figure 3-10 shows the idea. In this case, the two routers, R1 and R2, connect with an EoMPLS service instead of a serial link. The routers use Ethernet interfaces, and they can send data in both directions at the same time. Physically, each router actually connects to some SP PoP, as shown earlier in Figure 3-9, but logically, the two routers can send Ethernet frames to each other over the link. PC1 Ethernet LAN EoMPLS WAN Ethernet LAN PC2 R1 R2 Fiber Optic Ethernet Link G0/0G0/1 Figure 3-10 EoMPLS Acting Like a Simple Ethernet Link Between Two Routers How Routers Route IP Packets Using Ethernet Emulation WANs, by their very nature, give IP routers a way to forward IP packets from a LAN at one site, over the WAN, and to another LAN at another site. Routing over an EoMPLS WAN link still uses the WAN like a WAN, as a way to forward IP packets from one site to anoth- er. However, the WAN link happens to use the same Ethernet protocols as the Ethernet LAN links at each site. The EoMPLS link uses Ethernet for both Layer 1 and Layer 2 functions. That means the link uses the same familiar Ethernet header and trailer, as shown in the middle of Figure 3-11. PC1 LAN1 EoMPLS WAN LAN2 PC2 R1 R2 1 2 3 G0/0G0/1 Source = R1 G0/1 MAC Destination = R2 G0/0 MAC 802.3 802.3IP PacketHeader Trailer 802.3 802.3IP PacketHeader Trailer 802.3 802.3IP PacketHeader Trailer Figure 3-11 Routing over an EoMPLS Link NOTE This book shows EoMPLS connections as a familiar single black line, like other Ethernet links, but with a small cloud overlaid to note that this particular Ethernet link is through an Ethernet WAN service. The figure shows the same three routing steps as shown with the serial link in the earlier Figure 3-8. In this case, all three routing steps use the same Ethernet (802.3) protocol. However, note that each frame’s data-link header and trailer are different. Each router dis- cards the old data-link header/trailer and adds a new set, as described in these steps. Focus mainly on Step 2, because compared to the similar example shown in Figure 3-8, Steps 1 and 3 are unchanged: 72 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide 1. To send the IP packet to Router R1 next, PC1 encapsulates the IP packet in an Ethernet frame that has the destination MAC address of R1. 2. Router R1 de-encapsulates (removes) the IP packet from the Ethernet frame and encapsulates the packet into a new Ethernet frame, with a new Ethernet header and trailer. The destination MAC address is R2’s G0/0 MAC address, and the source MAC address is R1’s G0/1 MAC address. R1 forwards this frame over the EoMPLS service to R2 next. 3. Router R2 de-encapsulates (removes) the IP packet from the Ethernet frame, encapsu- lates the packet into an Ethernet frame that has the destination MAC address of PC2, and forwards the Ethernet frame to PC2. Accessing the Internet Many people begin their CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching study never having heard of leased lines, but many people have heard of two other WAN technologies used to gain access to the Internet: digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable. These two WAN tech- nologies do not replace leased lines in all cases, but they do play an important role in the specific case of creating a WAN connection between a home or office and the Internet. This last major section of the chapter begins by introducing the basic networking concepts behind the Internet, followed by some specifics of how DSL and cable provide a way to send data to/from the Internet. The Internet as a Large WAN The Internet is an amazing cultural phenomenon. Most of us use it every day. We post mes- sages on social media sites, we search for information using a search engine like Google, and we send emails. We use apps on our phones to pull down information, like weather reports, maps, and movie reviews. We use the Internet to purchase physical products and to buy and download digital products like music and videos. The Internet has created completely new things to do and changed the old ways of living life compared to a generation ago. However, if you instead focus on the networking technology that creates the Internet, the Internet is simply one huge TCP/IP network. In fact, the name “Internet” comes from the core network layer protocol: Internet Protocol. The Internet includes many LANs, and because the Internet spans the globe, it of course needs WAN links to connect different sites. As a network of networks, the Internet is actually owned by countless companies and people. The Internet includes most every enterprise TCP/IP network and a huge number of home-based networks, as well as a huge number of individuals from their phones and other wireless devices, as shown in Figure 3-12. The middle of the Internet, called the Internet core, exists as LANs and WANs owned and operated by Internet service providers (ISP). (Figure 3-12 shows the Internet core as a cloud, because network diagrams show a cloud when hiding the details of a part of the network.) ISPs cooperate to create a mesh of links between each other in the Internet core, so that no matter through which ISP a particular company or person connects, some path exists to every device.

Phone 1 Phone 2 Phone 3 Enterprise 1 Home 1 Home 2 Home 3 Enterprise 3 Enterprise 2 Mobile Phone Company ISP 2 ISP 3 Internet Core ISP 1 Figure 3-13 Internet Core with Multiple ISPs and Telcos Internet Access (WAN) Links The Internet also happens to use a huge number of WAN links. All of those lines connect- ing an enterprise or home to one of the ISPs in Figure 3-13 represent some kind of WAN link that uses a cable, while the phones create their WAN link using wireless technology. These links usually go by the name Internet access link. 74 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Historically, businesses tend to use one set of WAN technologies as Internet access links, while home-based consumers use others. Businesses often use leased lines, connecting a rout- er at the business to a router at the ISP. The top of Figure 3-14 shows just such an example. WAN WANIP Enterprise TCP/IP Network Leased Line WAN WANIP SOHO TCP/IP Network DSL WAN WANIP SOHO TCP/IP Network ISP Cable Figure 3-14 Three Examples of Internet Access Links Consumers often use technologies like DSL and cable for Internet access links. These tech- nologies use cabling that is already installed in most homes, making these services somewhat inexpensive for home users. DSL uses the analog phone lines that are already installed in homes, while cable Internet uses the cable TV (CATV) cable. NOTE While DSL and cable are popular with consumers, many businesses use these technologies for Internet access. All three of the Internet access technologies in Figure 3-14 happen to use a pair of routers: one at the customer side of the WAN link and one at the ISP side. The routers will continue to think about network layer logic, of sending IP packets to their destination by forward- ing the packets to the next router. However, the physical and data link layer details on the WAN link differ as compared to leased lines. The next few pages examine both DSL and cable Internet to show some of those differences. Digital Subscriber Line Digital subscriber line (DSL) creates a relatively short (miles long, not tens of miles) high- speed link WAN between a telco customer and an ISP. To do so, it uses the same single-pair telephone line used for a typical home phone line. DSL, as a technology, does not try to replace leased lines, which run between any two sites, for potentially very long distances. DSL instead just provides a short physical link from a home to the telco’s network, allowing access to the Internet. First, to get an idea about the cabling, think about typical home tele- phone service in the United States, before adding DSL service. Each home has one phone line that runs from a nearby telco CO to the home. As shown on the left side of Figure 3-15, the telephone wiring splits out and terminates at several wall plates, often with RJ-11 ports that are a slightly skinnier cousin of the RJ-45 connector. Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs 75 3Home Telco CO Splitter Telephone Line Voice Switch PSTN Figure 3-15 Typical Voice Cabling Concepts in the United States Next, think about the telephone line and the equipment at the CO. Sometime in the past, the telco installed all the telephone lines from its local CO to each neighborhood, apart- ment, and so on. At the CO, each line connects to a port on a telco switch. This switch sup- ports the ability to set up voice calls, take them down, and forward the voice through the worldwide voice network, called the public switched telephone network, or PSTN. To add DSL service at the home in Figure 3-15, two changes need to be made. First, you need to add DSL-capable devices at the home. Second, the telco has to add DSL equipment at the CO. Together, the DSL equipment at each side of the local telephone line can send data while still supporting the same voice traffic. The left side of Figure 3-16 shows the changes. A new DSL modem now connects to a spare phone outlet. The DSL modem follows the DSL physical and data link layer standards to send data to/from the telco. The home now has a small LAN, implemented with a consumer-grade router, which often includes an Ethernet switch and possibly a wireless LAN access point. (Note that the telephones may now also need a short extra cable with a filter in it, installed at the wall jack, to filter out the sounds of the higher electrical frequencies used for DSL.) Voice Switch PSTN Phone Cable DSL Modem Home Telco CO DSLAM Ethernet Cable Internet Telephone Line Figure 3-16 Wiring and Devices for a Home DSL Link 76 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The home-based router on the left must be able to send data to/from the Internet. To make that happen, the telco CO uses a product called a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM). The DSLAM splits out the data over to the router on the lower right, which completes the con- nection to the Internet. The DSLAM also splits out the voice signals over to the voice switch on the upper right. DSL gives telcos a useful high-speed Internet service to offer their customers. Telcos have had other offerings that happen to use the same telephone line for data, but these options ran much slower than DSL. DSL supports asymmetric speeds, meaning that the transmission speed from the ISP toward the home (downstream) is much faster than the transmissions toward the ISP (upstream). Asymmetric speeds work better for consumer Internet access from the home, because clicking a web page sends only a few hundred bytes upstream into the Internet, but can trigger many megabytes of data to be delivered downstream to the home. Cable Internet Cable Internet creates an Internet access service which, when viewed generally rather than specifically, has many similarities to DSL. Like DSL, cable Internet takes full advantage of existing cabling, using the existing cable TV (CATV) cable to send data. Like DSL, cable Internet uses asymmetric speeds, sending data faster downstream than upstream, which works better than symmetric speeds for most consumer locations. And like DSL, cable Internet does not attempt to replace long leased lines between any two sites, instead focus- ing on the short WAN links from a customer to an ISP. Cable Internet also uses the same basic in-home cabling concepts as does DSL. Figure 3-17 shows a figure based on the earlier DSL Figure 3-16, but with the DSL details replaced with cable Internet details. The telephone line has been replaced with coaxial cable from the CATV company, and the DSL modem has been replaced by a cable modem. Otherwise, the details in the home follow the same overall plan. CATV Cable Cable Modem Home Cable Co Ethernet Cable Internet Figure 3-17 Wiring and Devices for a Home Cable Internet Link On the CATV company side of the cable Internet service, the CATV company has to split out the data and video, as shown on the right side of the figure. Data flows to the lower right, through a router, while video comes in from video dishes for distribution out to the TVs in people’s homes. Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs 77 3 Cable Internet service and DSL directly compete for consumer and small-business Internet access. Generally speaking, while both offer high speeds, cable Internet typically runs at faster speeds than DSL, with DSL providers keeping their prices a little lower to compete. Both support asymmetric speeds, and both provide an “always on” service, in that you can communicate with the Internet without the need to first take some action to start the Internet connection.

That process requires cooperation among several different jobs and concepts on a number of devices. This chapter begins with an overview of all these cooperating functions, and then it dives into more detail about each area, as follows: IP routing: The process of hosts and routers forwarding IP packets (Layer 3 protocol data units [PDU]), while relying on the underlying LANs and WANs to forward the bits. IP addressing: Addresses used to identify a packet’s source and destination host comput- er. Addressing rules also organize addresses into groups, which greatly assists the routing process. IP routing protocol: A protocol that aids routers by dynamically learning about the IP address groups so that a router knows where to route IP packets so that they go to the right destination host. Other utilities: The network layer also relies on other utilities. For TCP/IP, these utilities include Domain Name System (DNS), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and ping. Note that all these functions have variations both for the well-established IP version 4 (IPv4) and for the emerging newer IP version 6 (IPv6). This chapter focuses on IPv4 and the related protocols. Part VIII of this book looks at the same kinds of functions for IPv6. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 81 4 Foundation Topics Overview of Network Layer Functions Many protocol models have existed over the years, but today the TCP/IP model dominates. And at the network layer of TCP/IP, two options exist for the main protocol around which all other network layer functions revolve: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6). Both IPv4 and IPv6 define the same kinds of network layer functions, but with different details. This chapter introduces these network layer functions for IPv4, leaving the IPv6 details until Part VIII of this book. NOTE All references to IP in this chapter refer to the older and more established IPv4. IP focuses on the job of routing data, in the form of IP packets, from the source host to the destination host. IP does not concern itself with the physical transmission of data, instead relying on the lower TCP/IP layers to do the physical transmission of the data. Instead, IP concerns itself with the logical details, rather than physical details, of delivering data. In par- ticular, the network layer specifies how packets travel end to end over a TCP/IP network, even when the packet crosses many different types of LAN and WAN links. This first section of the chapter begins a broad discussion of the TCP/IP network layer by looking at IP routing and addressing. The two topics work together, because IP routing relies on the structure and meaning of IP addresses, and IP addressing was designed with IP routing in mind. Following that, this overview section looks at routing protocols, which let routers learn the information they need to know to do routing correctly. Network Layer Routing (Forwarding) Logic Routers and end-user computers (called hosts in a TCP/IP network) work together to per- form IP routing. The host operating system (OS) has TCP/IP software, including the soft- ware that implements the network layer. Hosts use that software to choose where to send IP packets, often to a nearby router. Those routers make choices of where to send the IP packet next. Together, the hosts and routers deliver the IP packet to the correct destination, as shown in the example in Figure 4-1.

The next few pages discuss the network layer routing logic used by each device along the path. NOTE The term path selection is sometimes used to refer to the routing process shown in Figure 4-1. At other times, it refers to routing protocols, specifically how routing protocols select the best route among the competing routes to the same destination. Host Forwarding Logic: Send the Packet to the Default Router In this example, PC1 does some basic analysis, and then chooses to send the IP packet to the router so that the router will forward the packet. PC1 analyzes the destination address and realizes that PC2’s address (168.1.1.1) is not on the same LAN as PC1. So PC1’s logic tells it to send the packet to a device whose job it is to know where to route data: a nearby router, on the same LAN, called PC1’s default router. To send the IP packet to the default router, the sender sends a data-link frame across the medium to the nearby router; this frame includes the packet in the data portion of the frame. That frame uses data link layer (Layer 2) addressing in the data-link header to ensure that the nearby router receives the frame. Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 83 4 NOTE The default router is also referred to as the default gateway. R1 and R2’s Logic: Routing Data Across the Network All routers use the same general process to route the packet. Each router keeps an IP rout- ing table. This table lists IP address groupings, called IP networks and IP subnets. When a router receives a packet, it compares the packet’s destination IP address to the entries in the routing table and makes a match. This matching entry also lists directions that tell the router where to forward the packet next. In Figure 4-1, R1 would have matched the destination address (168.1.1.1) to a routing table entry, which in turn told R1 to send the packet to R2 next. Similarly, R2 would have matched a routing table entry that told R2 to send the packet, over an Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) link, to R3 next. The routing concept works a little like driving down the freeway when approaching a big interchange. You look up and see signs for nearby towns, telling you which exits to take to go to each town. Similarly, the router looks at the IP routing table (the equivalent of the road signs) and directs each packet over the correct next LAN or WAN link (the equivalent of a road). R3’s Logic: Delivering Data to the End Destination The final router in the path, R3, uses almost the same logic as R1 and R2, but with one minor difference. R3 needs to forward the packet directly to PC2, not to some other router. On the surface, that difference seems insignificant. In the next section, when you read about how the network layer uses LANs and WANs, the significance of the difference will become obvious. How Network Layer Routing Uses LANs and WANs While the network layer routing logic ignores the physical transmission details, the bits still have to be transmitted. To do that work, the network layer logic in a host or router must hand off the packet to the data link layer protocols, which, in turn, ask the physical layer to actually send the data. And as was described in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” the data link layer adds the appropriate header and trailer to the packet, creating a frame, before sending the frames over each physical network. The routing process forwards the network layer packet from end to end through the net- work, while each data-link frame only takes a smaller part of the trip. Each successive data link layer frame moves the packet to the next device that thinks about network layer logic. In short, the network layer thinks about the bigger view of the goal, like “Send this packet to the specified next device...,” while the data link layer thinks about the specifics, like “Encapsulate the packet in a data-link frame and transmit it.” Figure 4-2 points out the key encapsulation logic on each device, using the same examples as shown in Figure 4-1. 84 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide EoMPLS 10.1.1.1 Eth Encapsulate IP Packet in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in HDLC Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in Ethernet Extract IP Packet and Encapsulate in New Ethernet HDLC Eth Eth Eth HDLC Eth Eth IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet R1 R2 R3 PC1 168.1.1.1 PC2 Serial (HDLC) Figure 4-2 Network Layer and Data Link Layer Encapsulation Because the routers build new data-link headers and trailers, and because the new headers contain data-link addresses, the PCs and routers must have some way to decide what data- link addresses to use. An example of how the router determines which data-link address to use is the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). ARP dynamically learns the data-link address of an IP host connected to a LAN. For example, at the last step, at the bottom of Figure 4-2, Router R3 would use ARP once to learn PC2’s MAC address before sending any packets to PC2. Routing as covered so far has two main concepts: ■ The process of routing forwards Layer 3 packets, also called Layer 3 protocol data units (L3 PDU), based on the destination Layer 3 address in the packet. ■ The routing process uses the data link layer to encapsulate the Layer 3 packets into Layer 2 frames for transmission across each successive data link. IP Addressing and How Addressing Helps IP Routing IP defines network layer addresses that identify any host or router interface that connects to a TCP/IP network. The idea basically works like a postal address: Any interface that expects to receive IP packets needs an IP address, just like you need a postal address before receiving mail from the postal service. TCP/IP groups IP addresses together so that IP addresses used on the same physical network are part of the same group. IP calls these address groups an IP network or an IP subnet. Using that same postal service analogy, each IP network and IP subnet works like a postal code (or in the United States, a ZIP code). All nearby postal addresses are in the same postal code (ZIP code), while all nearby IP addresses must be in the same IP net- work or IP subnet. Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 85 4 NOTE IP defines the word network to mean a very specific concept. To avoid confusion when writing about IP addressing, this book (and others) often avoids using the term net- work for other uses. In particular, this book uses the term internetwork to refer more gen- erally to a network made up of routers, switches, cables, and other equipment. IP defines specific rules about which IP address should be in the same IP network or IP sub- net. Numerically, the addresses in the same group have the same value in the first part of the addresses. For example , Figures 4-1 and 4-2 could have used the following conventions: ■ Hosts on the top Ethernet: Addresses start with 10 ■ Hosts on the R1-R2 serial link: Addresses start with 168.10 ■ Hosts on the R2-R3 EoMPLS link: Addresses start with 168.11 ■ Hosts on the bottom Ethernet: Addresses start with 168.1 It’s similar to the USPS ZIP code system and how it requires local governments to assign addresses to new buildings. It would be ridiculous to have two houses next door to each other, whose addresses had different ZIP codes. Similarly, it would be silly to have people who live on opposite sides of the country to have addresses with the same ZIP code. Similarly, to make routing more efficient, network layer protocols group addresses, both by their location and by the actual address values. A router can list one routing table entry for each IP network or subnet, instead of one entry for every single IP address. The routing process also makes use of the IPv4 header, as shown in Figure 4-3. The header lists a 32-bit source IP address, as well as a 32-bit destination IP address. The header of course has other fields, a few of which matter for other discussions in this book. The book will refer to this figure as needed, but otherwise, be aware of the 20-byte IP header and the existence of the source and destination IP address fields. Version Length DS Field Packet Length Identification Fragment OffsetFlags Time to Live Protocol Header Checksum Source IP Address Destination IP Address 4 Bytes Figure 4-3 IPv4 Header, Organized as Four Bytes Wide for a Total of 20 Bytes Routing Protocols For routing logic to work on both hosts and routers, each needs to know something about the TCP/IP internetwork. Hosts need to know the IP address of their default router so that hosts can send packets to remote destinations. Routers, however, need to know routes so that routers know how to forward packets to each and every IP network and IP subnet. Although a network engineer could configure (type) all the required routes, on every router, most network engineers instead simply enable a routing protocol on all routers. If you 86 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide enable the same routing protocol on all the routers in a TCP/IP internetwork, with the cor- rect settings, the routers will send routing protocol messages to each other. As a result, all the routers will learn routes for all the IP networks and subnets in the TCP/IP internetwork. Figure 4-4 shows an example, using the same diagram as in Figures 4-1 and 4-2. In this case, IP network 168.1.0.0, which consists of all addresses that begin with 168.1, sits on the Ethernet at the bottom of the figure. R3, knowing this fact, sends a routing protocol mes- sage to R2 (Step 1). R2 learns a route for network 168.1.0.0 as a result, as shown on the left. At Step 2, R2 turns around and sends a routing protocol message to R1 so that R1 now has a route for that same IP network (168.1.0.0).

The rest of this chapter re-examines the key components in more depth. IPv4 Addressing IPv4 addressing may be the single most important topic for the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams. By the time you have finished reading this book, you should be com- fortable and confident in your understanding of IP addresses, their formats, the grouping concepts, how to subdivide groups into subnets, how to interpret the documentation for existing networks’ IP addressing, and so on. Simply put, you had better know addressing and subnetting! This section introduces IP addressing and subnetting and also covers the concepts behind the structure of an IP address, including how it relates to IP routing. In Parts III and V of this book, you will read more about the concepts and math behind IPv4 addressing and subnetting. Rules for IP Addresses If a device wants to communicate using TCP/IP, it needs an IP address. When the device has an IP address and the appropriate software and hardware, it can send and receive IP packets. Any device that has at least one interface with an IP address can send and receive IP packets and is called an IP host. Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 87 4 IP addresses consist of a 32-bit number, usually written in dotted-decimal notation (DDN). The “decimal” part of the term comes from the fact that each byte (8 bits) of the 32-bit IP address is shown as its decimal equivalent. The four resulting decimal numbers are writ- ten in sequence, with “dots,” or decimal points, separating the numbers—hence the name dotted-decimal. For example, 168.1.1.1 is an IP address written in dotted-decimal form; the actual binary version is 10101000 00000001 00000001 00000001. (You almost never need to write down the binary version, but you can use the conversion chart in Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” to easily convert from DDN to binary or vice versa.) Each DDN has four decimal octets, separated by periods. The term octet is just a vendor- neutral term for byte. Because each octet represents an 8-bit binary number, the range of decimal numbers in each octet is between 0 and 255, inclusive. For example, the IP address of 168.1.1.1 has a first octet of 168, the second octet of 1, and so on. Finally, note that each network interface uses a unique IP address. Most people tend to think that their computer has an IP address, but actually their computer’s network card has an IP address. For example, if your laptop has both an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) and a wireless NIC, with both working at the same time, both will have an IP address. Similarly, routers, which typically have many network interfaces that forward IP packets, have an IP address for each interface . Rules for Grouping IP Addresses The original specifications for TCP/IP grouped IP addresses into sets of consecutive addresses called IP networks. The addresses in a single IP network have the same numeric value in the first part of all addresses in the network. Figure 4-5 shows a simple internet- work that has three separate IP networks. Network 8.0.0.0 R1 R2 PC1 PC2 PC3 All Begin with 8 Network 130.4.0.0 All Begin with 130.4 Network 199.1.1.0 All Begin with 199.1.1 8.1.1.1 8.1.1.2 ?.?.?.? Figure 4-5 Sample TCP/IP Internetwork Using IPv4 Network Numbers The figure lists a network identifier (network ID) for each network, as well as a text descrip- tion of the DDN values in each network. For example, the hosts in the Ethernet LAN on the far left use IP addresses that begin with a first octet of 8; the network ID happens to be 8.0.0.0. As another example, the serial link between R1 and R2 consists of only two inter- faces—a serial interface on each router—and uses an IP address that begins with the three octets 199.1.1. Figure 4-5 also provides a good figure with which to discuss two important facts about how IPv4 groups IP addresses: ■ All IP addresses in the same group must not be separated from each other by a router. ■ IP addresses separated from each other by a router must be in different groups. 88 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Take the first of the two rules, and look at hosts A and B on the left. Hosts A and B are in the same IP network and have IP addresses that begin with 8. Per the first rule, hosts A and B cannot be separated from each other by a router (and they are indeed not separated from each other by a router). Next, take the second of the two rules and add host C to the discussion. Host C is separated from host A by at least one router, so host C cannot be in the same IP network as host A. Host C’s address cannot begin with 8. NOTE This example assumes the use of IP networks only, and no subnets, simply because the discussion has not yet dealt with the details of subnetting. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, IP address grouping behaves similarly to ZIP codes. Everyone in my ZIP code lives in a little town in Ohio. If some addresses in my ZIP code were in California, some mail might be delivered to the wrong local post office, because the postal service delivers the letters based on the postal (ZIP) codes. The post system relies on all addresses in one postal code being near to each other. Likewise, IP routing relies on all addresses in one IP network or IP subnet being in the same location, specifically on a single instance of a LAN or WAN data link. Otherwise, the rout- ers might deliver IP packets to the wrong locations. For any TCP/IP internetwork, each LAN and WAN link will use either an IP network or an IP subnet. Next, this chapter looks more closely at the concepts behind IP networks, fol- lowed by IP subnets. Class A, B, and C IP Networks The IPv4 address space includes all possible combinations of numbers for a 32-bit IPv4 address. Literally 232 different values exist with a 32-bit number, for more than 4 bil- lion different numbers. With DDN values, these numbers include all combinations of the values 0 through 255 in all four octets: 0.0.0.0, 0.0.0.1, 0.0.0.2, and all the way up to 255.255.255.255. IP standards first subdivide the entire address space into classes, as identified by the value of the first octet. Class A gets roughly half of the IPv4 address space, with all DDN num- bers that begin with 1–126, as shown in Figure 4-6. Class B gets one-fourth of the address space, with all DDN numbers that begin with 128–191 inclusive, and Class C gets one- eighth of the address space, with all numbers that begin with 192–223. Figure 4-6 also notes the purpose for the five address classes. Classes A, B, and C define unicast IP addresses, meaning that the address identifies a single host interface. Class D defines multicast addresses, used to send one packet to multiple hosts. Class E originally defined experimental addresses. (Class E addresses are no longer defined as experimental, and are simply reserved for future use.) IPv4 standards also subdivide the Class A, B, and C unicast classes into predefined IP net- works. Each IP network makes up a subset of the DDN values inside the class.

Class A networks each support a very large number of IP addresses (more than 16 million host addresses per IP network). However, because each Class A network is so large, Class A holds only 126 Class A net- works. Class B defines IP networks that have 65,534 addresses per network, but with space for more than 16,000 such networks. Class C defines much smaller IP networks, with 254 addresses each, as shown in Figure 4-7.

The figure shows clouds for IP networks. It, of course, does not show one cloud for every possible network, but shows the general idea, with a small number of large clouds for Class A and a large number of small clouds for Class C. The Actual Class A, B, and C IP Networks Figure 4-7 shows the number of Class A, B, and C IP networks in the entire world. Eventually, you need to actually pick and use some of these IP networks to build a working TCP/IP internetwork, so you need to be able to answer the question: What are the specific IP networks? First, you must be able to identify each network briefly using a network identifier (network ID). The network ID is just one reserved DDN value per network that identifies the IP net- work. (The network ID cannot be used by a host as an IP address.) For example, Table 4-2 shows the network IDs that match the earlier Figure 4- 5. Table 4-2 Network IDs Used in Figure 4-5 Concept Class Network ID All addresses that begin with 8 A 8.0.0.0 All addresses that begin with 130.4 B 130.4.0.0 All addresses that begin with 199.1.1 C 199.1.1.0 NOTE Many people use the term network ID, but others use the terms network number and network address. Be ready to use all three terms. So, what are the actual Class A, B, and C IP networks, and what are their network IDs? First, consider the Class A networks. Per Figure 4-7, only 126 Class A networks exist. As it turns out, they consist of all addresses that begin with 1, all addresses that begin with 2, all addresses that begin with 3, and so on, up through the 126th such network of “all addresses that begin with 126.” Table 4-3 lists a few of these networks. Table 4-3 Sampling of IPv4 Class A Networks Concept Class Network ID All addresses that begin with 8 A 8.0.0.0 All addresses that begin with 13 A 13.0.0.0 All addresses that begin with 24 A 24.0.0.0 All addresses that begin with 125 A 125.0.0.0 All addresses that begin with 126 A 126.0.0.0 Class B networks have a first octet value between 128 and 191, inclusive, but in a single Class B network, the addresses have the same value in the first two octets. For example, Figure 4-5 uses Class B network 130.4.0.0. The DDN value 130.4.0.0 must be in Class B, because the first octet is between 128 and 191, inclusive. However, the first two octets define the addresses in a single Class B network. Table 4-4 lists some sample IPv4 Class B networks.

With Class C networks and addresses, the first three octets define the group, with addresses in one Class C network having the same value in the first three octets. Table 4-5 shows some samples.

For study review, Table 4-6 summarizes the first octet values that identify the class and summarizes the range of Class A, B, and C network numbers available in the entire IPv4 address space.

IP Subnetting Like IP addressing, IP subnetting is also one of the most important topics for the CCENT and CCNA R&S certifications. You need to know how subnetting works and how to “do the math” to figure out issues when subnetting is in use, both in real life and on the exam. Parts IV and VI of this book cover the details of subnetting concepts, motivation, and math, but you should have a basic understanding of the concepts while reading the Ethernet top- ics between here and Part IV. Subnetting defines methods of further subdividing the IPv4 address space into groups that are smaller than a single IP network. IP subnetting defines a flexible way for anyone to take a single Class A, B, or C IP network and further subdivide it into even smaller groups of con- secutive IP addresses. In fact, the name subnet is just shorthand for subdivided network. 92 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Then, in each location where you used to use an entire Class A, B, or C network, you can use a smaller subnet, wasting fewer IP addresses. To make it clear how an internetwork can use both classful IPv4 networks as well as sub- nets of classful IPv4 networks, the next two figures show the same internetwork, one with classful networks only and one with subnets only. Figure 4-8 shows the first such example, which uses five Class B networks with no subnetting. Network 150.1.0.0 Network 150.4.0.0 Network 150.2.0.0 Network 150.5.0.0 Network 150.3.0.0 Core B1 B2 Figure 4-8 Example That Uses Five Class B Networks The design in Figure 4-8 requires five groups of IP addresses, each of which is a Class B network in this example. Specifically, the three LANs each use a single Class B network, and the two serial links each use a Class B network. Figure 4-8 wastes many IP addresses, because each Class B network has 216 – 2 host addresses—far more than you will ever need for each LAN and WAN link. For example, the Ethernet on the left uses an entire Class B network, which supports 65,534 IP addresses that begin with 150.1. However, a single LAN seldom grows past a few hundred devices, so many of the IP addresses in Class B network 150.1.0.0 would be wasted. Even more waste occurs on the point-to-point serial links, which need only two IP addresses. Figure 4-9 illustrates a more common design today, one that uses basic subnetting. As in the previous figure, this figure needs five groups of addresses. However, in this case, the figure uses five subnets of Class B network 150.9.0.0. Network 150.9.1.0 Network 150.9.4.0 Network 150.9.2.0 Network 150.9.5.0 Network 150.9.3.0 Core B1 B2 Figure 4-9 Using Subnets for the Same Design as the Previous Figure Subnetting allows the network engineer for the TCP/IP internetwork to choose to use a longer part of the addresses that must have the same value. Subnetting allows quite a bit of flexibility, but Figure 4-9 shows one of the simplest forms of subnetting. In this Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 93 4 case, each subnet includes the addresses that begin with the same value in the first three octets, as follows: ■ One group of the 254 addresses that begin with 150.9.1 ■ One group of the 254 addresses that begin with 150.9.2 ■ One group of the 254 addresses that begin with 150.9.3 ■ One group of the 254 addresses that begin with 150.9.4 ■ One group of the 254 addresses that begin with 150.9.5 As a result of using subnetting, the network engineer has saved many IP addresses. First, only a small part of Class B network 150.9.0.0 has been used so far. Each subnet has 254 addresses, which should be plenty of addresses for each LAN, and more than enough for the WAN links. In summary, you now know some of the details of IP addressing, with a focus on how it relates to routing. Each host and router interface will have an IP address. However, the IP addresses will not be randomly chosen but will instead be grouped together to aid the routing process. The groups of addresses can be an entire Class A, B, or C network number or it can be a subnet. IPv4 Routing In the first section of this chapter (“Overview of Network Layer Functions”), you read about the basics of IPv4 routing using a network with three routers and two PCs. Armed with more knowledge of IP addressing, you now can take a closer look at the process of routing IP. This section begins with the simple two-part routing logic on the originating host, and then moves on to discuss how routers choose where to route or forward packets to the final destination. IPv4 Host Routing Hosts actually use some simple routing logic when choosing where to send a packet. If you assume that the design uses subnets (which is typical), this two-step logic is as follows: Step 1. If the destination IP address is in the same IP subnet as I am, send the packet directly to that destination host. Step 2. Otherwise, send the packet to my default gateway, also known as a default router. (This router has an interface on the same subnet as the host.) For example, consider Figure 4-10 and focus on the Ethernet LAN on the left. When PC1 sends an IP packet to PC11 (150.9.1.11), PC1 first considers some match related to subnetting. PC1 concludes that PC11’s IP address is in the same subnet as PC1, so PC1 ignores its default router (Core, 150.9.1.1), sending the packet directly to PC11, as shown in Step 1 of the figure. 150.9.1.10 150.9.4.10150.9.1.1 150.9.1.11 Core B1 1 2 PC1 PC11 PC2 Figure 4-10 Host Routing: Forwarding to a Host on the Same Subnet 94 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Alternatively, when PC1 sends a packet to PC2 (150.9.4.10), PC1 does the same kind of subnetting math, and realizes that PC2 is not on the same subnet as PC1. So, PC1 forwards the packet (Step 2) to its default gateway, 150.9.1.1, which then routes the packet to PC2. Router Forwarding Decisions and the IP Routing Table Earlier in this chapter, Figure 4-1 shows the network layer concepts of routing, while Figure 4-2 shows the data-link encapsulation logic related to routing. This next topic dives a little deeper into that same process, using an example with three routers forward- ing (routing) one packet. But before looking at the example, the text first summarizes how a router thinks about forwarding a packet. A Summary of Router Forwarding Logic First, when a router receives a data-link frame addressed to that router’s data-link address, the router needs to think about processing the contents of the frame. When such a frame arrives, the router uses the following logic on the data-link frame: Step 1. Use the data-link Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field to ensure that the frame had no errors; if errors occurred, discard the frame. Step 2. Assuming that the frame was not discarded at Step 1, discard the old data-link header and trailer, leaving the IP packet. Step 3. Compare the IP packet’s destination IP address to the routing table, and find the route that best matches the destination address. This route identifies the outgoing interface of the router, and possibly the next-hop router IP address. Step 4. Encapsulate the IP packet inside a new data-link header and trailer, appropriate for the outgoing interface, and forward the frame. With these steps, each router forwards the packet to the next location, inside a data-link frame. With each router repeating this process, the packet reaches its final destination. While the router does all the steps in the list, Step 3 is the main routing or forwarding step. The packet has a destination IP address in the header, whereas the routing table lists slightly different numbers, typically a list of networks and subnets. To match a routing table entry, the router thinks like this: Network numbers and subnet numbers represent a group of addresses that begin with the same prefix. Think about those numbers as groups of addresses. In which of the groups does this packet’s destination address reside? The next example shows specific examples of matching the routing table. A Detailed Routing Example The routing example uses Figure 4-11. In this example, all routers happen to use the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, and all routers know routes for all subnets. In particular, PC2, at the bottom, sits in subnet 150.150.4.0, which consists of all addresses that begin with 150.150.4. In the example, PC1 sends an IP packet to 150.150.4.10, PC2’s IP address. Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 95 4 150.150.1.4 S0 E0 150.150.2.7 Eth HDLC Eth Eth IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet IP Packet R1 R2 R3 Subnet 150.150.4.0 A B C D Subnet Interface Next Hop 150.150.4.0 Serial0 150.150.2.7 R1 Routing Table Subnet Interface Next Hop 150.150.4.0 FastEth0/0 150.150.3.1 R2 Routing Table Subnet Interface Next Hop 150.150.4.0 Ethernet0 N/A R3 Routing Table 150.150.1.10 PC1 150.150.4.10PC2 150.150.3.1 F0/0 Figure 4-11 Simple Routing Example, with IP Subnets NOTE Note that the routers all know in this case that “subnet 150.150.4.0” means “all addresses that begin with 150.150.4.” The following list explains the forwarding logic at each step in the figure. (Note that the text refers to Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the routing logic shown in the previous section.) Step A. PC1 sends the packet to its default router. PC1 first builds the IP packet, with a destination address of PC2’s IP address (150.150.4.10). PC1 needs to send the packet to R1 (PC1’s default router) because the destination address is on a different subnet. PC1 places the IP packet into an Ethernet frame, with a destination Ethernet address of R1’s Ethernet address. PC1 sends the frame on to the Ethernet. (Note that the figure omits the data-link trailers.) Step B. R1 processes the incoming frame and forwards the packet to R2. Because the incoming Ethernet frame has a destination MAC of R1’s Ethernet MAC, R1 cop- ies the frame off the Ethernet for processing. R1 checks the frame’s FCS, and no errors have occurred (Step 1). R1 then discards the Ethernet header and trailer (Step 2). Next, R1 compares the packet’s destination address (150.150.4.10) to the routing table and finds the entry for subnet 150.150.4.0—which includes addresses 150.150.4.0 through 150.150.4.255 (Step 3). Because the destination address is in this group, R1 forwards the packet out interface Serial0 to next- hop Router R2 (150.150.2.7) after encapsulating the packet in a High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) frame (Step 4). Step C. R2 processes the incoming frame and forwards the packet to R3. R2 repeats the same general process as R1 when R2 receives the HDLC frame. R2 checks 96 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide the FCS field and finds that no errors occurred (Step 1). R2 then discards the HDLC header and trailer (Step 2). Next, R2 finds its route for subnet 150.150.4.0—which includes the address range 150.150.4.0–150.150.4.255— and realizes that the packet’s destination address 150.150.4.10 matches that route (Step 3). Finally, R2 sends the packet out interface Fast Ethernet 0/0 to next-hop router 150.150.3.1 (R3) after encapsulating the packet in an Ethernet header (Step 4). Step D. R3 processes the incoming frame and forwards the packet to PC2. Like R1 and R2, R3 checks the FCS, discards the old data-link header and trailer, and matches its own route for subnet 150.150.4.0. R3’s routing table entry for 150.150.4.0 shows that the outgoing interface is R3’s Ethernet interface, but there is no next-hop router because R3 is connected directly to subnet 150.150.4.0. All R3 has to do is encapsulate the packet inside a new Ethernet header and trailer, with a destination Ethernet address of PC2’s MAC address, and forward the frame. IPv4 Routing Protocols The routing (forwarding) process depends heavily on having an accurate and up-to-date IP routing table on each router. This section takes another look at routing protocols, consider- ing the goals of a routing protocol, the methods routing protocols use to teach and learn routes, and an example. First, consider the goals of a routing protocol, regardless of how the routing protocol works: ■ To dynamically learn and fill the routing table with a route to each subnet in the internetwork. ■ If more than one route to a subnet is available, to place the best route in the routing table. ■ To notice when routes in the table are no longer valid, and to remove them from the routing table. ■ If a route is removed from the routing table and another route through another neigh- boring router is available, to add the route to the routing table. (Many people view this goal and the preceding one as a single goal.) ■ To work quickly when adding new routes or replacing lost routes. (The time between losing the route and finding a working replacement route is called convergence time.) ■ To prevent routing loops. Routing protocols all use some similar ideas to allow routers to learn routing information from each other. Of course, each routing protocol works differently; otherwise, you would not need more than one routing protocol. However, many routing protocols use the same general steps for learning routes: Step 1. Each router, independent of the routing protocol, adds a route to its routing table for each subnet directly connected to the router. Step 2. Each router’s routing protocol tells its neighbors about the routes in its routing table, including the directly connected routes and routes learned from other routers. Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 97 4 Step 3. After learning a new route from a neighbor, the router’s routing protocol adds a route to its IP routing table, with the next-hop router of that route typically being the neighbor from which the route was learned. For example, Figure 4-12 shows the same sample network as in Figure 4-11, but now with a focus on how the three routers each learned about subnet 150.150.4.0. Note that routing protocols do more work than is implied in the figure; this figure just focuses on how the routers learn about subnet 150.150.4.0.

All references to Steps 1, 2, and 3 refer to the list just before Figure 4-12. Step A. Subnet 150.150.4.0 exists as a subnet at the bottom of the figure, connected to Router R3. Step B. R3 adds a connected route for 150.150.4.0 to its IP routing table (Step 1); this happens without help from the routing protocol. Step C. R3 sends a routing protocol message, called a routing update, to R2, causing R2 to learn about subnet 150.150.4.0 (Step 2). Step D. R2 adds a route for subnet 150.150.4.0 to its routing table (Step 3). Step E. R2 sends a similar routing update to R1, causing R1 to learn about subnet 150.150.4.0 (Step 2). Step F. R1 adds a route for subnet 150.150.4.0 to its routing table (Step 3). The route lists R1’s own Serial0 as the outgoing interface and R2 as the next-hop router IP address (150.150.2.7). 98 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Chapter 19, “Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2,” covers routing protocols in more detail. Next, the final major section of this chapter introduces several additional functions related to how the network layer forwards packets from source to destination through an internetwork. Other Network Layer Features The TCP/IP network layer defines many functions beyond the function defined by the IPv4 protocol. Sure, IPv4 plays a huge role in networking today, defining IP addressing and IP routing. However, other protocols and standards, defined in other Requests For Comments (RFC), play an important role for network layer functions as well. For exam- ple, routing protocols like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) exist as separate protocols, defined in separate RFCs. This last short section of the chapter introduces three other network layer features that should be helpful to you when reading through the rest of this book. These last three topics just help fill in a few holes, helping to give you some perspective, and helping you make sense of later discussions as well. The three topics are ■ Domain Name System (DNS) ■ Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) ■ Ping Using Names and the Domain Name System Can you imagine a world in which every time you used an application, you had to think about the other computer and refer to it by IP address? Instead of using easy names like google.com or facebook.com, you would have to remember and type IP addresses, like 74.125.225.5. Certainly, that would not be user friendly and could drive some people away from using computers at all. Thankfully, TCP/IP defines a way to use hostnames to identify other computers. The user either never thinks about the other computer or refers to the other computer by name. Then, protocols dynamically discover all the necessary information to allow communica- tions based on that name. For example, when you open a web browser and type in the hostname www.google.com, your computer does not send an IP packet with destination IP address www.google.com; it sends an IP packet to an IP address used by the web server for Google. TCP/IP needs a way to let a computer find the IP address used by the listed hostname, and that method uses the Domain Name System (DNS). Enterprises use the DNS process to resolve names into the matching IP address, as shown in the example in Figure 4-13. In this case, PC11, on the left, needs to connect to a server named Server1. At some point, the user either types in the name Server1 or some applica- tion on PC11 refers to that server by name. At Step 1, PC11 sends a DNS message—a DNS query—to the DNS server. At Step 2, the DNS server sends back a DNS reply that lists Server1’s IP address. At Step 3, PC11 can now send an IP packet to destination address 10.1.2.3, the address used by Server1. http://www.google.com http://www.google.com Chapter 4: Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing 99 4 11 DNS Server PC11 1 2 3 Server1 10.1.2.3 Server2 10.1.2.6 IP Address of Server1? Name Server1 Server2 Address 10.1.2.3 10.1.2.6 TCP/IP Network Server1 = 10.1.2.3 DNS Server Name Database IP Figure 4-13 Basic DNS Name Resolution Request Note that the example in Figure 4-13 shows a cloud for the TCP/IP network because the details of the network, including routers, do not matter to the name resolution process. Routers treat the DNS messages just like any other IP packet, routing them based on the destination IP address. For example, at Step 1 in the figure, the DNS query will list the DNS server’s IP address as the destination address, which any routers will use to forward the packet. Finally, DNS defines much more than just a few messages. DNS defines protocols, as well as standards for the text names used throughout the world, and a worldwide set of dis- tributed DNS servers. The domain names that people use every day when web browsing, which look like www.example.com, follow the DNS naming standards. Also, no single DNS server knows all the names and matching IP addresses, but the information is dis- tributed across many DNS servers. So, the DNS servers of the world work together, for- warding queries to each other, until the server that knows the answer supplies the desired IP address information. The Address Resolution Protocol IP routing logic requires that hosts and routers encapsulate IP packets inside data link layer frames. In fact, Figure 4-11 shows how every router de-encapsulates each IP packet and encapsulates the IP packet inside a new data-link frame. On Ethernet LANs, whenever a host or router needs to encapsulate an IP packet in a new Ethernet frame, the host or router knows all the important facts to build that header— except for the destination MAC address. The host knows the IP address of the next device, either another host IP address or the default router IP address. A router knows the IP route used for forwarding the IP packet, which lists the next router’s IP address. However, the hosts and routers do not know those neighboring devices’ MAC addresses beforehand. TCP/IP defines the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as the method by which any host or router on a LAN can dynamically learn the MAC address of another IP host or router on the same LAN. ARP defines a protocol that includes the ARP Request, which is a mes- sage that asks the simple request “if this is your IP address, please reply with your MAC address.” ARP also defines the ARP Reply message, which indeed lists both the original IP address and the matching MAC address. Figure 4-14 shows an example that uses the same router and host from the bottom part of the earlier Figure 4-11. The figure shows the ARP Request on the left as a LAN broadcast, so all hosts receive the frame. On the right, at Step 2, host PC2 sends back an ARP Reply, identifying PC2’s MAC address. The text beside each message shows the contents inside the ARP message itself, which lets PC2 learn R3’s IP address and matching MAC address, and R3 learn PC2’s IP address and matching MAC address. http://www.example.com 100 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide 150.150.4.10 0200.2222.2222 PC2 R3 ARP Reply ARP Request 6HQGHU�,3� �5�·V�,3 6HQGHU�0$&� �5�·V�0$& Target IP = 150.150.4.10 Target MAC = ??? 7DUJHW�,3� �5�·V�,3 7DUJHW�0DF� �5�·V�0$& Sender IP = 150.150.4.10 Sender MAC = 0200.2222.2222 1 2 Ethernet Broadcast Ethernet Unicast (to R3) Figure 4-14 Sample ARP Process Note that hosts remember the ARP results, keeping the information in their ARP cache or ARP table. A host or router only needs to use ARP occasionally, to build the ARP cache the first time. Each time a host or router needs to send a packet encapsulated in an Ethernet frame, it first checks its ARP cache for the correct IP address and matching MAC address. Hosts and routers will let ARP cache entries time out to clean up the table, so occasional ARP Requests can be seen. NOTE You can see the contents of the ARP cache on most PC operating systems by using the arp -a command from a command prompt. ICMP Echo and the ping Command After you have implemented a TCP/IP internetwork, you need a way to test basic IP con- nectivity without relying on any applications to be working. The primary tool for testing basic network connectivity is the ping command. Ping (Packet Internet Groper) uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), sending a message called an ICMP echo request to another IP address. The computer with that IP address should reply with an ICMP echo reply. If that works, you successfully have tested the IP network. In other words, you know that the network can deliver a packet from one host to the other and back. ICMP does not rely on any application, so it really just tests basic IP connectivity—Layers 1, 2, and 3 of the OSI model. Figure 4-15 outlines the basic process. Hannah ping Jessie Jessie Eth IP ICMP Echo Request Eth IP ICMP Echo Reply Figure 4-15 Sample Network, ping Command Note that while the ping command uses ICMP, ICMP does much more. ICMP defines many messages that devices can use to help manage and control the IP network.

This chapter explains the basics of a few topics that receive less attention on the exams: the TCP/IP transport layer and the TCP/IP application layer. The functions of these higher layers play a big role in real TCP/IP networks, so it helps to have some basic understanding before moving into the rest of the book, where you go deeper into LANs and IP routing. This chapter begins by examining the functions of two transport layer protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The second major section of the chapter examines the TCP/IP application layer, including some discussion of how Domain Name System (DNS) name resolution works. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Foundation Topics TCP/IP Layer 4 Protocols: TCP and UDP The OSI transport layer (Layer 4) defines several functions, the most important of which are error recovery and flow control. Likewise, the TCP/IP transport layer protocols also imple- ment these same types of features. Note that both the OSI model and the TCP/IP model call this layer the transport layer. But as usual, when referring to the TCP/IP model, the layer name and number are based on OSI, so any TCP/IP transport layer protocols are con- sidered Layer 4 protocols. The key difference between TCP and UDP is that TCP provides a wide variety of services to applications, whereas UDP does not. For example, routers discard packets for many rea- sons, including bit errors, congestion, and instances in which no correct routes are known. As you have read already, most data-link protocols notice errors (a process called error detection) but then discard frames that have errors. TCP provides retransmission (error recovery ) and helps to avoid congestion (flow control), whereas UDP does not. As a result, many application protocols choose to use TCP. However, do not let UDP’s lack of services make you think that UDP is worse than TCP. By providing fewer services, UDP needs fewer bytes in its header compared to TCP, resulting in fewer bytes of overhead in the network. UDP software does not slow down data transfer in cases where TCP can purposefully slow down. Also, some applications, notably today Voice over IP (VoIP) and video over IP, do not need error recovery, so they use UDP. So, UDP also has an important place in TCP/IP networks today. Table 5-2 lists the main features supported by TCP/UDP. Note that only the first item listed in the table is supported by UDP, whereas all items in the table are supported by TCP. Table 5-2 TCP/IP Transport Layer Features Function Description Multiplexing using ports Function that allows receiving hosts to choose the correct application for which the data is destined, based on the port number Error recovery (reliability) Process of numbering and acknowledging data with Sequence and Acknowledgment header fields Flow control using windowing Process that uses window sizes to protect buffer space and routing devices from being overloaded with traffic http://www.certskills.com Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 105 5 Function Description Connection establishment and termination Process used to initialize port numbers and Sequence and Acknowledgment fields Ordered data transfer and data segmentation Continuous stream of bytes from an upper-layer process that is “segmented” for transmission and delivered to upper-layer processes at the receiving device, with the bytes in the same order Next, this section describes the features of TCP, followed by a brief comparison to UDP. Transmission Control Protocol Each TCP/IP application typically chooses to use either TCP or UDP based on the applica- tion’s requirements. For example, TCP provides error recovery, but to do so, it consumes more bandwidth and uses more processing cycles. UDP does not perform error recovery, but it takes less bandwidth and uses fewer processing cycles. Regardless of which of these two TCP/IP transport layer protocols the application chooses to use, you should understand the basics of how each of these transport layer protocols works. TCP, as defined in Request For Comments (RFC) 793, accomplishes the functions listed in Table 5-2 through mechanisms at the endpoint computers. TCP relies on IP for end-to-end delivery of the data, including routing issues. In other words, TCP performs only part of the functions necessary to deliver the data between applications. Also, the role that it plays is directed toward providing services for the applications that sit at the endpoint computers. Regardless of whether two computers are on the same Ethernet, or are separated by the entire Internet, TCP performs its functions the same way. Figure 5-1 shows the fields in the TCP header. Although you don’t need to memorize the names of the fields or their locations, the rest of this section refers to several of the fields, so the entire header is included here for reference . 4 Bytes Offset Sequence Number Destination PortSource Port Reserved Flag Bits Window Checksum Urgent Acknowledgement Number Figure 5-1 TCP Header Fields Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 D, E 2 A, B, C, F 3 C 4 C, F 5 B 6 C, D 106 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The message created by TCP that begins with the TCP header, followed by any applica- tion data, is called a TCP segment. Alternatively, the more generic term Layer 4 PDU, or L4PDU, can also be used. Multiplexing Using TCP Port Numbers TCP and UDP both use a concept called multiplexing. Therefore, this section begins with an explanation of multiplexing with TCP and UDP. Afterward, the unique features of TCP are explored. Multiplexing by TCP and UDP involves the process of how a computer thinks when receiv- ing data. The computer might be running many applications, such as a web browser, an email package, or an Internet VoIP application (for example, Skype). TCP and UDP multi- plexing tells the receiving computer to which application to give the received data. Some examples will help make the need for multiplexing obvious. The sample network con- sists of two PCs, labeled Hannah and Jessie. Hannah uses an application that she wrote to send advertisements that appear on Jessie’s screen. The application sends a new ad to Jessie every 10 seconds. Hannah uses a second application, a wire-transfer application, to send Jessie some money. Finally, Hannah uses a web browser to access the web server that runs on Jessie’s PC. The ad application and wire-transfer application are imaginary, just for this example. The web application works just like it would in real life. Figure 5-2 shows the sample network, with Jessie running three applications: ■ A UDP-based advertisement application ■ A TCP-based wire-transfer application ■ A TCP web server application Hannah Web Server Ad Application Wire Application Jessie Eth UDP EthIP Ad Data Eth TCP EthIP Wire Transfer Data Eth TCP EthIP Web Page Data I received three packets from the same source MAC and IP. Which of my Applications gets the data in each? Figure 5-2 Hannah Sending Packets to Jessie, with Three Applications Jessie needs to know which application to give the data to, but all three packets are from the same Ethernet and IP address. You might think that Jessie could look at whether the packet contains a UDP or TCP header, but as you see in the figure, two applications (wire transfer and web) are using TCP. Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 107 5 TCP and UDP solve this problem by using a port number field in the TCP or UDP header, respectively. Each of Hannah’s TCP and UDP segments uses a different destination port number so that Jessie knows which application to give the data to. Figure 5-3 shows an example. Hannah Port 80 Web Server Port 800 Ad Server Port 9876 Wire Application Jessie Eth UDP EthIP Ad Data Eth TCP EthIP Wire Transfer Data Eth TCP EthIP Web Page Data Destination Port 80 ,·OO�/RRN�LQ�WKH UDP or TCP Destination Port to Identify the Application! Destination Port 800 Destination Port 9876 Figure 5-3 Hannah Sending Packets to Jessie, with Three Applications Using Port Numbers to Multiplex Multiplexing relies on a concept called a socket. A socket consists of three things: ■ An IP address ■ A transport protocol ■ A port number So, for a web server application on Jessie, the socket would be (10.1.1.2, TCP, port 80) because, by default, web servers use the well-known port 80. When Hannah’s web browser connects to the web server, Hannah uses a socket as well—possibly one like this: (10.1.1.1, TCP, 1030). Why 1030? Well, Hannah just needs a port number that is unique on Hannah, so Hannah sees that port 1030 is available and uses it. In fact, hosts typically allocate dynamic port numbers starting at 1024 because the ports below 1024 are reserved for well- known applications. In Figure 5-3, Hannah and Jessie use three applications at the same time—hence, three socket connections are open. Because a socket on a single computer should be unique, a connection between two sockets should identify a unique connection between two comput- ers. This uniqueness means that you can use multiple applications at the same time, talking to applications running on the same or different computers. Multiplexing, based on sockets, ensures that the data is delivered to the correct applications. Figure 5-4 shows the three socket connections between Hannah and Jessie. 108 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Hannah Jessie Ad Application Port 1025 Wire Application Port 1028 Web Browser Port 1030 UDP TCP IP Address 10.1.1.1 Ad Application Port 800 Wire Application Port 9876 Web Server Port 80 UDP TCP IP Address 10.1.1.2 (10.1.1.1, TCP, 1030) (10.1.1.2, TCP, 80) (10.1.1.1, TCP, 1028) (10.1.1.2, TCP, 9876) (10.1.1.1, UDP, 1025) (10.1.1.2, UDP, 800) Figure 5-4 Connections Between Sockets Port numbers are a vital part of the socket concept. Well-known port numbers are used by servers; other port numbers are used by clients. Applications that provide a service, such as FTP, Telnet, and web servers, open a socket using a well-known port and listen for con- nection requests. Because these connection requests from clients are required to include both the source and destination port numbers, the port numbers used by the servers must be well-known. Therefore, each service uses a specific well-known port number. The well- known ports are listed at www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service- names-port-numbers.txt . On client machines, where the requests originate, any locally unused port number can be allocated. The result is that each client on the same host uses a different port number, but a server uses the same port number for all connections. For example, 100 web browsers on the same host computer could each connect to a web server, but the web server with 100 clients connected to it would have only one socket and, therefore, only one port number (port 80, in this case). The server can tell which packets are sent from which of the 100 cli- ents by looking at the source port of received TCP segments. The server can send data to the correct web client (browser) by sending data to that same port number listed as a desti- nation port. The combination of source and destination sockets allows all participating hosts to distinguish between the data’s source and destination. Although the example explains the concept using 100 TCP connections, the same port-numbering concept applies to UDP ses- sions in the same way.

Popular TCP/IP Applications Throughout your preparation for the CCNA Routing and Switching exams, you will come across a variety of TCP/IP applications. You should at least be aware of some of the appli- cations that can be used to help manage and control a network. http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc http://www.rfc-editor.org Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 109 5 The World Wide Web (WWW) application exists through web browsers accessing the con- tent available on web servers. Although it is often thought of as an end-user application, you can actually use WWW to manage a router or switch. You enable a web server function in the router or switch and use a browser to access the router or switch. The Domain Name System (DNS) allows users to use names to refer to computers, with DNS being used to find the corresponding IP addresses. DNS also uses a client/server model, with DNS servers being controlled by networking personnel and DNS client functions being part of most any device that uses TCP/IP today. The client simply asks the DNS server to supply the IP address that corresponds to a given name. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application layer protocol used specifi- cally for network device management. For example, Cisco supplies a large variety of network management products, many of them in the Cisco Prime network management software product family. They can be used to query, compile, store, and display information about a network’s operation. To query the network devices, Cisco Prime software mainly uses SNMP protocols. Traditionally, to move files to and from a router or switch, Cisco used Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) . TFTP defines a protocol for basic file transfer—hence the word trivial. Alternatively, routers and switches can use File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is a much more functional protocol, to transfer files. Both work well for moving files into and out of Cisco devices. FTP allows many more features, making it a good choice for the general end-user population. TFTP client and server applications are very simple, making them good tools as embedded parts of networking devices. Some of these applications use TCP, and some use UDP. For example, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), both used for transferring mail, require guaranteed delivery, so they use TCP. Regardless of which transport layer protocol is used, applications use a well-known port number so that clients know which port to attempt to connect to. Table 5-3 lists several popular applications and their well-known port numbers. Table 5-3 Popular Applications and Their Well-Known Port Numbers Port Number Protocol Application 20 TCP FTP data 21 TCP FTP control 22 TCP SSH 23 TCP Telnet 25 TCP SMTP 53 UDP, TCP1 DNS 67 UDP DHCP Server 68 UDP DHCP Client 69 UDP TFTP 80 TCP HTTP (WWW) 110 TCP POP3 161 UDP SNMP 110 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Port Number Protocol Application 443 TCP SSL 514 UDP Syslog 1 DNS uses both UDP and TCP in different instances. It uses port 53 for both TCP and UDP. Connection Establishment and Termination TCP connection establishment occurs before any of the other TCP features can begin their work. Connection establishment refers to the process of initializing Sequence and Acknowledgment fields and agreeing on the port numbers used. Figure 5-5 shows an exam- ple of connection establishment flow. SYN, DPORT=80, SPORT=1027 Web Browser Web Server SYN, ACK, DPORT=1027, SPORT=80 ACK, DPORT=80, SPORT=1027 Port 1027 Port 80 Figure 5-5 TCP Connection Establishment This three-way connection establishment flow (also called a three-way handshake) must complete before data transfer can begin. The connection exists between the two sockets, although the TCP header has no single socket field. Of the three parts of a socket, the IP addresses are implied based on the source and destination IP addresses in the IP header. TCP is implied because a TCP header is in use, as specified by the protocol field value in the IP header. Therefore, the only parts of the socket that need to be encoded in the TCP header are the port numbers. TCP signals connection establishment using 2 bits inside the flag fields of the TCP header. Call- ed th e SYN and ACK flags, these bits have a particularly interesting meaning. SYN means “syn- chronize the sequence numbers,” which is one necessary component in initialization for TCP. Figure 5-6 shows TCP connection termination. This four-way termination sequence is straightforward and uses an additional flag, called the FIN bit. (FIN is short for “finished,” as you might guess.) One interesting note: Before the device on the right sends the third TCP segment in the sequence, it notifies the application that the connection is coming down. It then waits on an acknowledgment from the application before sending the third segment in the figure. Just in case the application takes some time to reply, the PC on the right sends the second flow in the figure, acknowledging that the other PC wants to take down the connec- tion. Otherwise, the PC on the left might resend the first segment repeatedly. PC ACK, FIN PC ACK ACK ACK, F IN Figure 5-6 TCP Connection Termination Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 111 5 TCP establishes and terminates connections between the endpoints, whereas UDP does not. Many protocols operate under these same concepts, so the terms connection-oriented and connectionless are used to refer to the general idea of each. More formally, these terms can be defined as follows : ■ Connection-oriented protocol: A protocol that requires an exchange of messages before data transfer begins, or that has a required pre-established correlation between two endpoints. ■ Connectionless protocol: A protocol that does not require an exchange of messages and that does not require a pre-established correlation between two endpoints. Error Recovery and Reliability TCP provides for reliable data transfer, which is also called reliability or error recovery, depending on what document you read. To accomplish reliability, TCP numbers data bytes using the Sequence and Acknowledgment fields in the TCP header. TCP achieves reliability in both directions, using the Sequence Number field of one direction combined with the Acknowledgment field in the opposite direction. Figure 5-7 shows an example of how the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields allow the PC to send 3000 bytes of data to the server, with the server acknowledging receipt of the data. The TCP segments in the figure occur in order, from top to bottom. For simplic- ity’s sake, all messages happen to have 1000 bytes of data in the data portion of the TCP segment. The first Sequence number is a nice round number (1000), again for simplicity’s sake. The top of the figure shows three segments, with each sequence number being 1000 more than the previous, identifying the first of the 1000 bytes in the message. (That is, in this example, the first segment holds bytes 1000–1999; the second holds bytes 2000–2999; and the third holds bytes 3000–3999.) 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 1000 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 2000 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 3000 No Data, Acknowledgment = 4000 Got All 3000 Bytes. Send ACK 1 Web Browser Web Server Figure 5-7 TCP Acknowledgment Without Errors The fourth TCP segment in the figure—the only one flowing back from the server to the web browser—acknowledges the receipt of all three segments. How? The acknowledgment value of 4000 means “I received all data with sequence numbers up through one less than 4000, so I am ready to receive your byte 4000 next.” (Note that this convention of acknowl- edging by listing the next expected byte, rather than the number of the last byte received, is called forward acknowledgment.) This first example does not recover from any errors, however; it simply shows the basics of how the sending host uses the sequence number field to identify the data, with the receiv- ing host using forward acknowledgments to acknowledge the data. The more interesting discussion revolves around how to use these same tools to do error recovery. TCP uses the sequence and acknowledgment fields so that the receiving host can notice lost data, ask the sending host to resend, and then acknowledge that the re-sent data arrived. 112 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Many variations exist for how TCP does error recovery. Figure 5-8 shows just one such example, with similar details compared to the previous figure. The web browser again sends three TCP segments, again 1000 bytes each, again with easy-to-remember sequence num- bers. However, in this example, the second TCP segment fails to cross the network. I Received 1000 – 1999. I Received 3000 – 3999. Ask for 2000 Next! 1 He Lost Segment with SEQ = 2000. Resend it! 2 I Received 2000 – 2999. Already Have 3000 – 3999. Ask for 4000 Next! 3 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 1000 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 2000 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 3000 Web Browser Web Server No Data, Acknowledgment = 2000 1000 Bytes of Data, Sequence = 2000 No Data, Acknowledgment = 4000 Figure 5-8 TCP Acknowledgment with Errors The figure points out three sets of ideas behind how the two hosts think. First, on the right, the server realizes that it did not receive all the data. The two received TCP segments con- tain bytes numbered 1000–1999 and 3000–3999. Clearly, the server did not receive the bytes numbered in between. The server then decides to acknowledge all the data up to the lost data—that is, to send back a segment with the acknowledgment field equal to 2000. The receipt of an acknowledgment that does not acknowledge all the data sent so far tells the sending host to resend the data. The PC on the left may wait a few moments to make sure no other acknowledgments arrive (using a timer called the retransmission timer), but will soon decide that the server means “I really do need 2000 next—resend it.” The PC on the left does so, as shown in the fifth of the six TCP segments in the figure. Finally, note that the server can acknowledge not only the re-sent data, but any earlier data that had been received correctly. In this case, the server received the re-sent second TCP seg- ment (the data with sequence numbers 2000–2999), but the server had already received the third TCP segment (the data numbered 3000–3999). The server’s next acknowledgment field acknowledges the data in both those segments, with an acknowledgment field of 4000. Flow Control Using Windowing TCP implements flow control by using a window concept that is applied to the amount of data that can be outstanding and awaiting acknowledgment at any one point in time. The window concept lets the receiving host tell the sender how much data it can receive right now, giving the receiving host a way to make the sending host slow down or speed up. The receiver can slide the window size up and down—called a sliding window or dynamic win- dow—to change how much data the sending host can send. The sliding window mechanism makes much more sense with an example. The example, shown in Figure 5-9, uses the same basic rules as the examples in the previous few figures. Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 113 5 In this case, none of the TCP segments have errors, and the discussion begins one TCP seg- ment earlier than in the previous two figures. ACK=1000 Window=3000 SEQ=1000 SEQ=2000 SEQ=3000 ACK=4000 Window=4000 Send an ACK = 4000 Grant a New Window: 4000 3 I Received a New Window: 3000 1 I Must Wait for an ACK 2 I got an ACK! I also got a Larger Window: 4000 4 Web Browser Web Server Figure 5-9 TCP Windowing Begin with the first segment, sent by the server to the PC. The Acknowledgment field should be familiar by now: it tells the PC that the server expects a segment with sequence number 1000 next. The new field, the window field, is set to 3000. Because the segment flows to the PC, this value tells the PC that the PC can send no more than 3000 bytes over this connection before receiving an acknowledgment. So, as shown on the left, the PC real- izes it can send only 3000 bytes, and it stops sending, waiting on an acknowledgment, after sending three 1000-byte TCP segments. Continuing the example, the server not only acknowledges receiving the data (without any loss), but the server decides to slide the window size a little higher. Note that second message flowing right-to-left in the figure, this time with a window of 4000. Once the PC receives this TCP segment, the PC realizes it can send another 4000 bytes (a slightly larger window than the previous value). Note that while the last few figures show examples for the purpose of explaining how the mechanisms work, the examples might give you the impression that TCP makes the hosts sit there and wait for acknowledgments a lot. TCP does not want to make the sending host have to wait to send data. For instance, if an acknowledgment is received before the win- dow is exhausted, a new window begins, and the sender continues sending data until the current w indow is exhausted. Often times, in a network that has few problems, few lost segments, and little congestion, the TCP windows stay relatively large with hosts seldom waiting to send. User Datagram Protocol UDP provides a service for applications to exchange messages. Unlike TCP, UDP is connec- tionless and provides no reliability, no windowing, no reordering of the received data, and no segmentation of large chunks of data into the right size for transmission. However, UDP provides some functions of TCP, such as data transfer and multiplexing using port numbers, and it does so with fewer bytes of overhead and less processing required than TCP. 114 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide UDP data transfer differs from TCP data transfer in that no reordering or recovery is accomplished. Applications that use UDP are tolerant of the lost data, or they have some application mechanism to recover lost data. For example, VoIP uses UDP because if a voice packet is lost, by the time the loss could be noticed and the packet retransmitted, too much delay would have occurred, and the voice would be unintelligible. Also, DNS requests use UDP because the user will retry an operation if the DNS resolution fails. As another exam- ple, the Network File System (NFS), a remote file system application, performs recovery with application layer code, so UDP features are acceptable to NFS. Figure 5-10 shows the UDP header format. Most importantly, note that the header includes source and destination port fields, for the same purpose as TCP. However, the UDP has only 8 bytes, in comparison to the 20-byte TCP header shown in Figure 5-1. UDP needs a shorter header than TCP simply because UDP has less work to do. 4 Bytes Destination PortSource Port Length Checksum Figure 5-10 UDP Header TCP/IP Applications The whole goal of building an enterprise network, or connecting a small home or office net- work to the Internet, is to use applications such as web browsing, text messaging, email, file downloads, voice, and video. This section examines one particular application—web brows- ing using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The World Wide Web (WWW) consists of all the Internet-connected web servers in the world, plus all Internet-connected hosts with web browsers. Web servers, which consist of web server software running on a computer, store information (in the form of web pages) that might be useful to different people. A web browser, which is software installed on an end user’s computer, provides the means to connect to a web server and display the web pages stored on the web server. NOTE Although most people use the term web browser, or simply browser, web brows- ers are also called web clients, because they obtain a service from a web server. For this process to work, several specific application layer functions must occur. The user must somehow identify the server, the specific web page, and the protocol used to get the data from the server. The client must find the server’s IP address, based on the server’s name, typically using DNS. The client must request the web page, which actually consists of multiple separate files, and the server must send the files to the web browser. Finally, for electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications, the transfer of data, particularly sensitive financial data, needs to be secure. The following sections address each of these functions. Uniform Resource Identifiers For a browser to display a web page, the browser must identify the server that has the web page, plus other information that identifies the particular web page. Most web servers have many web pages. For example, if you use a web browser to browse www.cisco.com and you http://www.cisco.com Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 115 5 click around that web page, you’ll see another web page. Click again, and you’ll see another web page. In each case, the clicking action identifies the server’s IP address as well as the specific web page, with the details mostly hidden from you. (These clickable items on a web page, which in turn bring you to another web page, are called links.) The browser user can identify a web page when you click something on a web page or when you enter a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in the browser’s address area. Both options— clicking a link and typing a URI—refer to a URI, because when you click a link on a web page, that link actually refers to a URI. NOTE Most browsers support some way to view the hidden URI referenced by a link. In several browsers, hover the mouse pointer over a link, right-click, and select Properties. The pop-up window should display the URI to which the browser would be directed if you clicked that link. In common speech, many people use the terms web address or the similar related term Universal Resource Locator (URL) instead of URI, but URI is indeed the correct formal term. In fact, URL had been more commonly used than URI for more than a few years. However, the IETF (the group that defines TCP/IP), along with the W3C consortium (W3.org, a consortium that develops web standards) has made a concerted effort to standardize the use of URI as the general term. See RFC 7595 for some commentary to that effect. From a practical perspective, the URIs used to connect to a web server include three key components, as noted in Figure 5-11. The figure shows the formal names of the URI fields. More importantly to this discussion, note that the text before the :// identifies the protocol used to connect to the server, the text between the // and / identifies the server by name, and the text after the / identifies the web page. Formal: URI Scheme http://www.certskills.com/blog Example: Web Authority Path Protocol 6HUYHU·V�1DPH Web Page Figure 5-11 Structure of a URI Used to Retrieve a Web Page In this case, the protocol is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the hostname is www. certskills.com, and the name of the web page is blog. Finding the Web Server Using DNS As mentioned in Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing,” a host can use DNS to discover the IP address that corresponds to a particular hostname. URIs typically list the name of the server—a name that can be used to dynamically learn the IP address used by that same server. The web browser cannot send an IP packet to a destination name, but it can send a packet to a destination IP address. So, before the browser can send a pack- et to the web server, the browser typically needs to resolve the name inside the URI to that name’s corresponding IP address. http://www.certskills.com/blog http://www.certskills.com http://www.certskills.com 116 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide To pull together several concepts, Figure 5-12 shows the DNS process as initiated by a web browser, as well as some other related information. From a basic perspective, the user enters the URI (in this case, http://www.cisco.com/go/learningnetwork), resolves the www.cisco. com name into the correct IP address, and starts sending packets to the web server.

Port 80, SYN TCP Connection Setup Name Resolution Reply The human typed this URI: http://www.cisco.com/go/learningnetwork Figure 5-12 DNS Resolution and Requesting a Web Page The steps shown in the figure are as follows: 1. The user enters the URI, http://www.cisco.com/go/learningnetwork, into the brows- er’s address area. 2. The client sends a DNS request to the DNS server. Typically, the client learns the DNS server’s IP address through DHCP. Note that the DNS request uses a UDP head- er, with a destination port of the DNS well-known port of 53. (See Table 5-3, earlier in this chapter, for a list of popular well-known ports.) 3. The DNS server sends a reply, listing IP address 198.133.219.25 as www.cisco.com’s IP address. Note also that the reply shows a destination IP address of 64.100.1.1, the client’s IP address. It also shows a UDP header, with source port 53; the source port is 53 because the data is sourced, or sent by, the DNS server. 4. The client begins the process of establishing a new TCP connection to the web server. Note that the destination IP address is the just-learned IP address of the web server. The packet includes a TCP header, because HTTP uses TCP. Also note that the desti- nation TCP port is 80, the well-known port for HTTP. Finally, the SYN bit is shown, as a reminder that the TCP connection establishment process begins with a TCP seg- ment with the SYN bit turned on (binary 1). http://www.cisco.com/go/learningnetwork http://www.cisco.com http://www.cisco.com http://www.cisco.com http://www.cisco.com? http://www.cisco.com/go/learningnetwork http://www.cisco.com/go/learningnetwork Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 117 5 At this point in the process, the web browser is almost finished setting up a TCP connection to the web server. The next section picks up the story at that point, examining how the web browser then gets the files that comprise the desired web page. Transferring Files with HTTP After a web client (browser) has created a TCP connection to a web server, the client can begin requesting the web page from the server. Most often, the protocol used to transfer the web page is HTTP. The HTTP application layer protocol, defined in RFC 7230, defines how files can be transferred between two computers. HTTP was specifically created for the purpose of transferring files between web servers and web clients. HTTP defines several commands and responses, with the most frequently used being the HTTP GET request . To get a file from a web server, the client sends an HTTP GET request to the server, listing the filename. If the server decides to send the file, the server sends an HTTP GET response, with a return code of 200 (meaning OK), along with the file’s contents. NOTE Many return codes exist for HTTP requests. For example, when the server does not have the requested file, it issues a return code of 404, which means “file not found.” Most web browsers do not show the specific numeric HTTP return codes, instead displaying a response such as “page not found” in reaction to receiving a return code of 404. Web pages typically consist of multiple files, called objects. Most web pages contain text as well as several graphical images, animated advertisements, and possibly voice or video. Each of these components is stored as a different object (file) on the web server. To get them all, the web browser gets the first file. This file can (and typically does) include references to other URIs, so the browser then also requests the other objects. Figure 5-13 shows the gen- eral idea, with the browser getting the first file and then two others. HTTP GET (/go/ccna) HTTP GET /graphics/logo1.gif HTTP GET /graphics/ad1.gif HTTP OK data: /go/ccna data: logo1.gifHTTP OK data: ad1.gifHTTP OK Web Browser (Client) www.cisco.com User Typed: http://www.cisco.com/go/ccna Figure 5-13 Multiple HTTP Get Requests/Responses In this case, after the web browser gets the first file—the one called “/go/ccna” in the URI—the browser reads and interprets that file. Besides containing parts of the web page, the file refers to two other files, so the browser issues two additional HTTP get requests. Note that, even though it isn’t shown in the figure, all these commands flow over one (or http://www.cisco.com http://www.cisco.com/go/ccna 118 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide possibly more) TCP connection between the client and the server. This means that TCP would provide error recovery, ensuring that the data was delivered. How the Receiving Host Identifies the Correct Receiving Application This chapter closes with a discussion that pulls several concepts together from several chap- ters in Part I of this book. The concept revolves around the process by which a host, when receiving any message over any network, can decide which of its many application programs should process the received data. As an example, consider host A shown on the left side of Figure 5-14. The host happens to have three different web browser windows open, each using a unique TCP port. Host A also has an email client and a chat window open, both of which use TCP. Both the email and chat applications use a unique TCP port number on host A as well (1027 and 1028) as shown in the figure. Eth. IP TCP(Dest Port) HTTP + Data A Browser: Browser: Browser: Email: Chat: TCP port 1024 TCP port 1025 TCP port 1026 TCP port 1027 TCP port 1028 Web Server Figure 5-14 Dilemma: How Host A Chooses the App That Should Receive This Data This chapter has shown several examples of how Transport layer protocols use the destina- tion port number field in the TCP or UDP header to identify the receiving application. For instance, if the destination TCP port value in Figure 5-15 is 1024, host A will know that the data is meant for the first of the three web browser windows. Before a receiving host can even examine the TCP or UDP header, and find the destination port field, it must first process the outer headers in the message. If the incoming message is an Ethernet frame, that encapsulates an IPv4 packet, the headers look like the details in Figure 5-15. Web Server Ethernet (Type) IPv4 (Protocol) TCP (Dest Port) 102460x0800 HTTP and Data Figure 5-15 Three Key Fields with Which to Identify the Next Header The receiving host needs to look at multiple fields, one per header, to identify the next header or field in the received message. For instance, host A uses an Ethernet NIC to con- nect to the network, so the received message is an Ethernet frame. As first shown back in Figure 2-16 in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” the Ethernet Type field identi- fies the type of header that follows the Ethernet header—in this case, with a value of hex 0800, an IPv4 header. Chapter 5: Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications 119 5 The IPv4 header has a similar field called the IP Protocol field. The IPv4 Protocol field has a standard list of values that identify the next header, with decimal 6 used for TCP and deci- mal 17 used for UDP. In this case, the value of 6 identifies the TCP header that follows the IPv4 header. Once the receiving host realizes a TCP header exists, it can process the destina- tion port field to determine which local application process should receive the data.

If you do not remem- ber some details, take the time to reread those topics, or use the Key Topics application(s) found on the companion website and the DVD. Create Terminology Mind Maps The first part of this book introduces a large amount of terminology. The sheer number of terms can be overwhelming. But more and more, while you work through each new chapter, you will become more comfortable with the terms. And the better you can remember the core meaning of a term, the easier your reading will be going forward. For your first mind map exercise in this book, without looking back at the chapters or your notes, you will create six mind maps. The mind maps will each list a number in the center, 1 through 6, to match the numbers shown in Figure P1-1. Your job is as follows: ■ Think of every term that you can remember from Part I of the book. ■ Think of each of the six mind maps as being about the item next to the number in Figure P1-1. For example, number 1 is about the user PC, number 2 is about an Ethernet cable that connects PC1 to a switch, and so on. ■ Add each term that you can recall to all mind maps to which it applies. For example, leased line would apply to mind map number 5. ■ If a term seems to apply to multiple places, add it to all those mind maps. ■ After you have written every term you can remember into one of the mind maps, review the Key Terms lists at the end of Chapters 1 through 5. Add any terms you forgot to your mind maps. Core B1 1 2 3 4 5 6 Figure P1-1 Sample Network to Use with Mind Map Exercise The goal of these minds maps is to help you recall the terms with enough meaning to associ- ate the terms with the right part of a simple network design. On your first review of Part I, do not be concerned if you cannot fully explain each term, because you will learn many of these terms more fully just by reading the rest of the book.

Parts II and III now drill into depth about the details of Ethernet, which was introduced back in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs.” Part II begins that journey by discussing the basics of building a small Ethernet LAN with Cisco Catalyst switches. The journey begins by showing how to access the user interface of a Cisco switch, so that you can see evidence of what the switch is doing and to configure the switch to act in the ways you want it to act. At this point, you should start using what- ever lab practice option you chose in the “Your Study Plan” section that preceded Chapter 1, “Introduction to TCP/IP Networking.” (And if you have not yet finalized your plan for how to practice your hands-on skills, now is the time.) When you complete Chapter 6 and see how to get into the command-line interface (CLI) of a switch, the next three chapters step through some important foundations of how to implement LANs—foundations used by every company that builds LANs with Cisco gear. Chapter 7 takes a close look at Ethernet switching—that is, the logic used by a switch—and how to know what a particular switch is doing. Chapter 8 shows the ways to configure a switch for remote access with Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH), along with a variety of other useful commands that will help you when you work with any real lab gear, simulator, or any other practice tools. Chapter 9, the final chapter in Part II, shows how to configure switch interfaces for several important features: port security and the inter-related features of speed, duplex, and autonegotiation. Part II Implementing Basic Ethernet LANs Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface Chapter 7: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management Chapter 9: Configuring Switch Interfaces Part II Review CHAPTER 6 Using the Command-Line Interface This chapter covers the following exam topics: 1.0 Network Fundamentals 1.6 Select the appropriate cabling type based on implementation requirements NOTE This chapter primarily explains foundational skills required before you can explore the roughly 20 exam topics that use the verbs configure, verify, and troubleshoot. To create an Ethernet LAN, a network engineer starts by planning. They consider the requirements, create a design, buy the switches, contract to install cables, and configure the switches to use the right features. The CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams focus on skills like understanding how LANs work, configuring different switch features, verifying that those features work correctly, and finding the root cause of the problem when a feature is not working cor- rectly. The first skill you need to learn before doing all the configuration, verification, and troubleshooting tasks is to learn how to access and use the user interface of the switch, called the command-line interface (CLI). This chapter begins that process by showing the basics of how to access the switch’s CLI. These skills include how to access the CLI and how to issue verification commands to check on the status of the LAN. This chapter also includes the processes of how to configure the switch and how to save that configuration. Note that this chapter focuses on processes that provide a foundation for most every exam topic that includes the verbs configure, verify, and troubleshoot. Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching,” Chapter 8, “Configuring Basic Switch Management,” and Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” then examine particular commands you can use to verify and configure different switch features. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Using the quit command Foundation Topics Accessing the Cisco Catalyst Switch CLI Cisco uses the concept of a command-line interface (CLI) with its router products and most of its Catalyst LAN switch products. The CLI is a text-based interface in which the user, typically a network engineer, enters a text command and presses Enter. Pressing Enter sends the command to the switch, which tells the device to do something. The switch does what the command says, and in some cases, the switch replies with some messages stating the results of the command. Cisco Catalyst switches also support other methods to both monitor and configure a switch. For example, a switch can provide a web interface, so that an engineer can open a web browser to connect to a web server running in the switch. Switches also can be controlled and operated using network management software. This book discusses only Cisco Catalyst enterprise-class switches, and in particular, how to use the Cisco CLI to monitor and control these switches. This first major section of the chapter first examines these Catalyst switches in more detail, and then explains how a net- work engineer can get access to the CLI to issue commands. Cisco Catalyst Switches Within the Cisco Catalyst brand of LAN switches, Cisco produces a wide variety of switch series or families. Each switch series includes several specific models of switches that have similar features, similar price-versus-performance trade-offs, and similar internal components. For example, at the time this book was published, the Cisco 2960-X series of switches was a current switch model series. Cisco positions the 2960-X series (family) of switches as full-featured, low-cost wiring closet switches for enterprises. That means that you would expect to use 2960-X switches as access switches in a typical campus LAN design. Chapter 10, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs,” discusses campus LAN design and the roles of various switches. Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 129 6 Figure 6-1 shows a photo of 10 different models from the 2960-X switch model series from Cisco. Each switch series includes several models, with a mix of features. For example, some of the switches have 48 RJ-45 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) 10/100/1000 ports, meaning that these ports can autonegotiate the use of 10BASE-T (10 Mbps), 100BASE-T (100 Mbps), or 1000BASE-T (1 Gbps) Ethernet. Figure 6-1 Cisco 2960-X Catalyst Switch Series Cisco refers to a switch’s physical connectors as either interfaces or ports, with an interface type and interface number. The interface type, as used in commands on the switch, is either Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and so on for faster speeds. For Ethernet inter- faces that support running at multiple speeds, the permanent name for the interface refers to the fastest supported speed. For example, a 10/100/1000 interface (that is, an interface that runs at 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1000 Mbps) would be called Gigabit Ethernet no mat- ter what speed is currently in use. To uniquely number each different interface, some Catalyst switches use a two-digit interface number (x/y), while others have a three-digit number (x/y/z). For instance, two 10/100/1000 ports on many older Cisco Catalyst switches would be called Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 and Gigabit Ethernet 0/1, while on the newer 2960-X series, two interfaces would be Gigabit Ethernet 1/0/1 and Gigabit Ethernet 1/0/2, for example. Accessing the Cisco IOS CLI Like any other piece of computer hardware, Cisco switches need some kind of operating system software. Cisco calls this OS the Internetwork Operating System (IOS). Cisco IOS Software for Catalyst switches implements and controls logic and functions per- formed by a Cisco switch. Besides controlling the switch’s performance and behavior, Cisco IOS also defines an interface for humans called the CLI. The Cisco IOS CLI allows the user to use a terminal emulation program, which accepts text entered by the user. When the user presses Enter, the terminal emulator sends that text to the switch. The switch processes the text as if it is a command, does what the command says, and sends text back to the terminal emulator. The switch CLI can be accessed through three popular methods—the console, Telnet, and Secure Shell (SSH). Two of these methods (Telnet and SSH) use the IP network in which the switch resides to reach the switch. The console is a physical port built specifically to allow access to the CLI. Figure 6-2 depicts the options. Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 A, B 2 B 3 B 4 A 5 F 6 B, C 130 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Console User Mode Interface 2960 Switch Telnet and SSH (Short) Console Cable RJ-45 or USB Serial or USB TCP/IP Network Figure 6-2 CLI Access Options Console access requires both a physical connection between a PC (or other user device) and the switch’s console port, as well as some software on the PC. Telnet and SSH require software on the user’s device, but they rely on the existing TCP/IP network to transmit data. The next few pages detail how to connect the console and set up the software for each method to access the CLI . Cabling the Console Connection The physical console connection, both old and new, uses three main components: the physi- cal console port on the switch, a physical serial port on the PC, and a cable that works with the console and serial ports. However, the physical cabling details have changed slowly over time, mainly because of advances and changes with serial interfaces on PC hardware. For this next topic, the text looks at three cases: newer connectors on both the PC and the switch, older connectors on both, and a third case with the newer (USB) connector on the PC but with an older connector on the switch. More modern PC and switch hardware use a familiar standard USB cable for the console connection. Cisco has been including USB ports as console ports in newer routers and switches as well. All you have to do is look at the switch to make sure you have the cor- rect style of USB cable end to match the USB console port. In the simplest form, you can use any USB port on the PC, with a USB cable, connected to the USB console port on the switch or router, as shown on the far right side of Figure 6-3. 1 RJ-45 Console Serial Port Rollover Cable SW1 2 RJ-45 Console USB Port USB Converter USB Cable Rollover Cable SW2 3 USB Console USB Port USB Cable SW3SW1 SW2 SW3 Figure 6-3 Console Connection to a Switch Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 131 6 Older console connections use a PC serial port that pre-dates USB, a UTP cable, and an RJ-45 console port on the switch, as shown on the left side of Figure 6-3. The PC serial port typically has a D-shell connector (roughly rectangular) with nine pins (often called a DB-9). The console port looks like any Ethernet RJ-45 port (but is typically colored in blue and with the word “console” beside it on the switch). The cabling for this older-style console connection can be simple or require some effort, depending on what cable you use. You can use the purpose-built console cable that ships with new Cisco switches and routers and not think about the details. However, you can make your own cable with a standard serial cable (with a connector that matches the PC), a standard RJ-45 to DB-9 converter plug, and a UTP cable. However, the UTP cable does not use the same pinouts as Ethernet; instead, the cable uses rollover cable pinouts rather than any of the standard Ethernet cabling pinouts. The rollover pinout uses eight wires, rolling the wire at pin 1 to pin 8, pin 2 to pin 7, pin 3 to pin 6, and so on. As it turns out, USB ports became common on PCs before Cisco began commonly using USB for its console ports. So, you also have to be ready to use a PC that has only a USB port and not an old serial port, but a router or switch that has the older RJ-45 console port (and no USB console port). The center of Figure 6-3 shows that case. To connect such a PC to a router or switch console, you need a USB converter that converts from the older console cable to a USB connector, and a rollover UTP cable, as shown in the middle of Figure 6-3. NOTE When using the USB options, you typically also need to install a software driver so that your PC’s OS knows that the device on the other end of the USB connection is the console of a Cisco device. Also, you can easily find photos of these cables and components online, with searches like “cisco console cable,” “cisco usb console cable,” or “console cable converter.” The newer 2960-X series, for instance, supports both the older RJ-45 console port and a USB console port. Figure 6-4 points to the two console ports; you would use only one or the other. Note that the USB console port uses a mini-B port rather than the more com- monly seen rectangular standard USB port. USB Console (Mini-B) RJ-45 Console Figure 6-4 A Part of a 2960-X Switch with Console Ports Shown 132 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide After the PC is physically connected to the console port, a terminal emulator software package must be installed and configured on the PC. The terminal emulator software treats all data as text. It accepts the text typed by the user and sends it over the console connec- tion to the switch. Similarly, any bits coming into the PC over the console connection are displayed as text for the user to read. The emulator must be configured to use the PC’s serial port to match the settings on the switch’s console port settings. The default console port settings on a switch are as follows. Note that the last three parameters are referred to collectively as 8N1: ■ 9600 bits/second ■ No hardware flow control ■ 8-bit ASCII ■ No parity bits ■ 1 stop bit Figure 6-5 shows one such terminal emulator. The image shows the window created by the emulator software in the background, with some output of a show command. The fore- ground, in the upper left, shows a settings window that lists the default console settings as listed just before this paragraph. Figure 6-5 Terminal Settings for Console Access Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 133 6 Accessing the CLI with Telnet and SSH For many years, terminal emulator applications have supported far more than the ability to communicate over a serial port to a local device (like a switch’s console). Terminal emulators support a variety of TCP/IP applications as well, including Telnet and SSH. Telnet and SSH both allow the user to connect to another device’s CLI, but instead of connecting through a console cable to the console port, the traffic flows over the same IP network that the net- working devices are helping to create. Telnet uses the concept of a Telnet client (the terminal application) and a Telnet server (the switch in this case). A Telnet client, the device that sits in front of the user, accepts keyboard input and sends those commands to the Telnet server. The Telnet server accepts the text, interprets the text as a command, and replies back. Telnet is a TCP-based appli- cation layer protocol that uses well-known port 23. Cisco Catalyst switches enable a Telnet server by default, but switches need a few more configuration settings before you can successfully use Telnet to connect to a switch. Chapter 8 covers switch configuration to support Telnet and SSH in detail. Using Telnet in a lab today makes sense, but Telnet poses a significant security risk in pro- duction networks. Telnet sends all data (including any username and password for login to the switch) as clear-text data. SSH gives us a much better option. Think of SSH as the much more secure Telnet cousin. Outwardly, you still open a terminal emulator, connect to the switch’s IP address, and see the switch CLI, no matter whether you use Telnet or SSH. The differences exist behind the scenes: SSH encrypts the contents of all messages, including the passwords, avoiding the possibility of someone capturing packets in the network and stealing the password to network devices. Like Telnet, SSH uses TCP, just using well-known port 22 instead of Telnet’s 23. User and Enable (Privileged) Modes All three CLI access methods covered so far (console, Telnet, and SSH) place the user in an area of the CLI called user EXEC mode. User EXEC mode, sometimes also called user mode, allows the user to look around but not break anything. The “EXEC mode” part of the name refers to the fact that in this mode, when you enter a command, the switch executes the command and then displays messages that describe the command’s results. NOTE If you have not used the CLI before, you might want to experiment with the CLI from the Sim Lite product, or view the video about CLI basics. You can find these resources on the DVD and on the companion website, as mentioned in the introduction. Cisco IOS supports a more powerful EXEC mode called enable mode (also known as privi- leged mode or privileged EXEC mode). Enable mode gets its name from the enable com- mand, which moves the user from user mode to enable mode, as shown in Figure 6-6. The other name for this mode, privileged mode, refers to the fact that powerful (or privileged) commands can be executed there. For example, you can use the reload command, which tells the switch to reinitialize or reboot Cisco IOS, only from enable mode. 134 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide User Mode Console Telnet SSH Enable (Command) Disable (Command) Enable Mode (Privileged Mode) Figure 6-6 User and Privileged Modes NOTE If the command prompt lists the hostname followed by a >, the user is in user mode; if it is the hostname followed by the #, the user is in enable mode. Example 6-1 demonstrates the differences between user and enable modes. The example shows the output that you could see in a terminal emulator window, for instance, when con- necting from the console. In this case, the user sits at the user mode prompt (“Certskills1>”) and tries the reload command. The reload command tells the switch to reinitialize or reboot Cisco IOS, so IOS allows this powerful command to be used only from enable mode. IOS rejects the reload command when used in user mode. Then the user moves to enable mode—also called privileged mode—(using the enable EXEC command). At that point, IOS accepts the reload command now that the user is in enable mode. Example 6-1 Example of Privileged Mode Commands Being Rejected in User Mode Press RETURN to get started. User Access Verification Password: Certskills1> Certskills1> reload Translating \"reload\" % Unknown command or computer name, or unable to find computer address Certskills1> enable Password: Certskills1# Certskills1# reload Proceed with reload? [confirm] y 00:08:42: %SYS-5-RELOAD: Reload requested by console. Reload Reason: Reload Command. Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 135 6 NOTE The commands that can be used in either user (EXEC) mode or enable (EXEC) mode are called EXEC commands. This example is the first instance of this book showing you the output from the CLI, so it is worth noting a few conventions. The bold text represents what the user typed, and the non- bold text is what the switch sent back to the terminal emulator. Also, the typed passwords do not show up on the screen for security purposes. Finally, note that this switch has been preconfigured with a hostname of Certskills1, so the command prompt on the left shows that hostname on each line. Password Security for CLI Access from the Console A Cisco switch, with default settings, remains relatively secure when locked inside a wir- ing closet, because by default, a switch allows console access only. By default, the console requires no password at all, and no password to reach enable mode for users that happened to connect from the console. The reason is that if you have access to the physical con- sole port of the switch, you already have pretty much complete control over the switch. You could literally get out your screwdriver and walk off with it, or you could unplug the power, or follow well-published procedures to go through password recovery to break into the CLI and then configure anything you want to configure. However, many people go ahead and set up simple password protection for console users. Simple passwords can be configured at two points in the login process from the console: when the user connects from the console, and when any user moves to enable mode (using the enable EXEC command). You may have noticed that back in Example 6-1, the user saw a password prompt at both points. Example 6-2 shows the additional configuration commands that were configured prior to collecting the output in Example 6-1. The output holds an excerpt from the EXEC com- mand show running-config, which lists the current configuration in the switch. Example 6-2 Nondefault Basic Configuration Certskills1# show running-config ! Output has been formatted to show only the parts relevant to this discussion hostname Certskills1 ! enable secret love ! line console 0 login password faith ! The rest of the output has been omitted Certskills1# Working from top to bottom, note that the first configuration command listed by the show running-config command sets the switch’s hostname to Certskills1. You might have noticed that the command prompts in Example 6-1 all began with Certskills1, and that’s why the command prompt begins with the hostname of the switch. 136 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Next, note that the lines with a ! in them are comment lines, both in the text of this book and in the real switch CLI. The enable secret love configuration command defines the password that all users must use to reach enable mode. So, no matter whether a user connects from the console, Telnet, or SSH, they would use password love when prompted for a password after typing the enable EXEC command. Finally, the last three lines configure the console password. The first line (line console 0) is the command that identifies the console, basically meaning “these next commands apply to the console only.” The login command tells IOS to perform simple password checking (at the console). Remember, by default, the switch does not ask for a password for console users. Finally, the password faith command defines the password the console user must type when prompted. This example just scratches the surface of the kinds of security configuration you might choose to configure on a switch, but it does give you enough detail to configure switches in your lab and get started (which is the reason I put these details in this first chapter of Part II). Note that Chapter 8 shows the configuration steps to add support for Telnet and SSH (including password security), and Chapter 34, “Device Security Features,” shows additional security configuration as well. CLI Help Features If you printed the Cisco IOS Command Reference documents, you would end up with a stack of paper several feet tall. No one should expect to memorize all the commands—and no one does. You can use several very easy, convenient tools to help remember commands and save time typing. As you progress through your Cisco certifications, the exams will cover progressively more commands. However, you should know the methods of getting command help. Table 6-2 summarizes command-recall help options available at the CLI. Note that, in the first column, command represents any command. Likewise, parm represents a command’s parameter. For example, the third row lists command ?, which means that commands such as show ? and copy ? would list help for the show and copy commands, respectively. Table 6-2 Cisco IOS Software Command Help What You Enter What Help You Get ? Help for all commands available in this mode. command ? With a space between the command and the ?, the switch lists text to describe all the first parameter options for the command. com? A list of commands that start with com. command parm? Lists all parameters beginning with the parameter typed so far. (Notice that there is no space between parm and the ?.) command parm<Tab> Pressing the Tab key causes IOS to spell out the rest of the word, assuming that you have typed enough of the word so there is only one option that begins with that string of characters. command parm1 ? If a space is inserted before the question mark, the CLI lists all the next parameters and gives a brief explanation of each. Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 137 6 When you enter the ?, the Cisco IOS CLI reacts immediately; that is, you don’t need to press the Enter key or any other keys. The device running Cisco IOS also redisplays what you entered before the ? to save you some keystrokes. If you press Enter immediately after the ?, Cisco IOS tries to execute the command with only the parameters you have entered so far. The information supplied by using help depends on the CLI mode. For example, when ? is entered in user mode, the commands allowed in user mode are displayed, but com- mands available only in enable mode (not in user mode) are not displayed. Also, help is available in configuration mode, which is the mode used to configure the switch. In fact, configuration mode has many different subconfiguration modes, as explained in the section “Configuration Submodes and Contexts,” later in this chapter. So, you can get help for the commands available in each configuration submode as well. (Note that this might be a good time to use the free NetSim Lite product on the DVD—open any lab, use the question mark, and try some commands.) Cisco IOS stores the commands that you enter in a history buffer, storing ten commands by default. The CLI allows you to move backward and forward in the historical list of com- mands and then edit the command before reissuing it. These key sequences can help you use the CLI more quickly on the exams. Table 6-3 lists the commands used to manipulate previously entered commands . Table 6-3 Key Sequences for Command Edit and Recall Keyboard Command What Happens Up arrow or Ctrl+P This displays the most recently used command. If you press it again, the next most recent command appears, until the history buffer is exhausted. (The P stands for previous.) Down arrow or Ctrl+N If you have gone too far back into the history buffer, these keys take you forward to the more recently entered commands. (The N stands for next.) Left arrow or Ctrl+B This moves the cursor backward in the currently displayed command without deleting characters. (The B stands for back.) Right arrow or Ctrl+F This moves the cursor forward in the currently displayed command without deleting characters. (The F stands for forward.) Backspace This moves the cursor backward in the currently displayed command, deleting characters . The debug and show Commands By far, the single most popular Cisco IOS command is the show command. The show command has a large variety of options, and with those options, you can find the status of almost every feature of Cisco IOS. Essentially, the show command lists the currently known facts about the switch’s operational status. The only work the switch does in reac- tion to show commands is to find the current status and list the information in messages sent to the user. For example, consider the output from the show mac address-table dynamic command listed in Example 6-3. This show command, issued from user mode, lists the table the switch uses to make forwarding decisions. A switch’s MAC address table basically lists the data a switch uses to do its primary job. 138 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Example 6-3 Nondefault Basic Configuration Certskills1> show mac address-table dynamic Mac Address Table ------------------------------------------- Vlan Mac Address Type Ports ---- ----------- -------- ----- 31 0200.1111.1111 DYNAMIC Gi0/1 31 0200.3333.3333 DYNAMIC Fa0/3 31 1833.9d7b.0e9a DYNAMIC Gi0/1 10 1833.9d7b.0e9a DYNAMIC Gi0/1 10 30f7.0d29.8561 DYNAMIC Gi0/1 1 1833.9d7b.0e9a DYNAMIC Gi0/1 12 1833.9d7b.0e9a DYNAMIC Gi0/1 Total Mac Addresses for this criterion: 7 Certskills1> The debug command also tells the user details about the operation of the switch. However, while the show command lists status information at one instant of time—more like a pho- tograph—the debug command acts more like a live video camera feed. Once you issue a debug command, IOS remembers, issuing messages that any switch user can choose to see. The console sees these messages by default. Most of the commands used throughout this book to verify operation of switches and routers are show commands. Configuring Cisco IOS Software You will want to configure every switch in an Enterprise network, even though the switches will forward traffic even with default configuration. This section covers the basic configu- ration processes, including the concept of a configuration file and the locations in which the configuration files can be stored. Although this section focuses on the configuration process, and not on the configuration commands themselves, you should know all the com- mands covered in this chapter for the exams, in addition to the configuration processes. Configuration mode is another mode for the Cisco CLI, similar to user mode and privileged mode. User mode lets you issue non-disruptive commands and displays some information. Privileged mode supports a superset of commands compared to user mode, including com- mands that might disrupt switch operations. However, none of the commands in user or privileged mode changes the switch’s configuration. Configuration mode accepts configura- tion commands —commands that tell the switch the details of what to do and how to do it. Figure 6-7 illustrates the relationships among configuration mode, user EXEC mode, and privileged EXEC mode . configure terminal end or Ctl-Z Configuration ModeUser Mode enable disable Enable Mode Figure 6-7 CLI Configuration Mode Versus EXEC Modes Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 139 6 Commands entered in configuration mode update the active configuration file. These changes to the configuration occur immediately each time you press the Enter key at the end of a command. Be careful when you enter a configuration command! Configuration Submodes and Contexts Configuration mode itself contains a multitude of commands. To help organize the configu- ration, IOS groups some kinds of configuration commands together. To do that, when using configuration mode, you move from the initial mode—global configuration mode—into subcommand modes. Context-setting commands move you from one configuration sub- command mode, or context, to another. These context-setting commands tell the switch the topic about which you will enter the next few configuration commands. More importantly, the context tells the switch the topic you care about right now, so when you use the ? to get help, the switch gives you help about that topic only. NOTE Context-setting is not a Cisco term. It is just a description used here to help make sense of configuration mode. The best way to learn about configuration submodes is to use them, but first, take a look at these upcoming examples. For instance, the interface command is one of the most com- monly used context-setting configuration commands. For example, the CLI user could enter interface configuration mode by entering the interface FastEthernet 0/1 configuration command. Asking for help in interface configuration mode displays only commands that are useful when configuring Ethernet interfaces. Commands used in this context are called sub- commands—or, in this specific case, interface subcommands. When you begin practicing with the CLI with real equipment, the navigation between modes can become natural. For now, consider Example 6-4, which shows the following : ■ Movement from enable mode to global configuration mode by using the configure terminal EXEC command ■ Using a hostname Fred global configuration command to configure the switch’s name ■ Movement from global configuration mode to console line configuration mode (using the line console 0 command) ■ Setting the console’s simple password to hope (using the password hope line subcom- mand) ■ Movement from console configuration mode to interface configuration mode (using the interface type number command) ■ Setting the speed to 100 Mbps for interface Fa0/1 (using the speed 100 interface sub- command) ■ Movement from interface configuration mode back to global configuration mode (using the exit command) Example 6-4 Navigating Between Different Configuration Modes Switch# configure terminal Switch(config)# hostname Fred Fred(config)# line console 0 Fred(config-line)# password hope Fred(config-line)# interface FastEthernet 0/1 140 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Fred(config-if)# speed 100 Fred(config-if)# exit Fred(config)# The text inside parentheses in the command prompt identifies the configuration mode. For example, the first command prompt after you enter configuration mode lists (config), meaning global configuration mode. After the line console 0 command, the text expands to (config-line), meaning line configuration mode. Each time the command prompt changes within config mode, you have moved to another configuration mode. Table 6-4 shows the most common command prompts in configuration mode, the names of those modes, and the context-setting commands used to reach those modes. Table 6-4 Common Switch Configuration Modes Prompt Name of Mode Context-Setting Command(s) to Reach This Mode hostname(config)# Global None—first mode after configure terminal hostname(config-line)# Line line console 0 line vty 0 15 hostname(config-if)# Interface interface type number hostname(vlan)# VLAN vlan number You should practice until you become comfortable moving between the different configu- ration modes, back to enable mode, and then back into the configuration modes. However, you can learn these skills just doing labs about the topics in later chapters of the book. For now, Figure 6-8 shows most of the navigation between global configuration mode and the four configuration submodes listed in Table 6-4. interface type/number End or Ctl-Z exit Interface Mode configure terminal End or Ctl-Z Enable Mode Global Config Mode vlan x exit VLAN Mode line console 0 exit Console Line Mode line vty 0 15 exit VTY Line Mode Figure 6-8 Navigation In and Out of Switch Configuration Modes Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 141 6 NOTE You can also move directly from one configuration submode to another, without first using the exit command to move back to global configuration mode. Just use the com- mands listed in bold in the center of the figure. You really should stop and try navigating around these configuration modes. If you have not yet decided on a lab strategy, spin the DVD in the back of the book, and install the Pearson Sim Lite software. It includes the simulator and a couple of lab exercises. Start any lab, ignore the instructions, and just get into configuration mode and move around between the configuration modes shown in Figure 6-8. No set rules exist for what commands are global commands or subcommands. Generally, however, when multiple instances of a parameter can be set in a single switch, the command used to set the parameter is likely a configuration subcommand. Items that are set once for the entire switch are likely global commands. For example, the hostname command is a global command because there is only one hostname per switch. Conversely, the speed command is an interface subcommand that applies to each switch interface that can run at different speeds, so it is a subcommand, applying to the particular interface under which it is configured. Storing Switch Configuration Files When you configure a switch, it needs to use the configuration. It also needs to be able to retain the configuration in case the switch loses power. Cisco switches contain random-access memory (RAM) to store data while Cisco IOS is using it, but RAM loses its contents when the switch loses power or is reloaded. To store information that must be retained when the switch loses power or is reloaded, Cisco switches use several types of more permanent memory, none of which has any moving parts. By avoiding components with moving parts (such as traditional disk drives), switches can maintain better uptime and availability. The following list details the four main types of memory found in Cisco switches, as well as the most common use of each type: ■ RAM: Sometimes called DRAM, for dynamic random-access memory, RAM is used by the switch just as it is used by any other computer: for working storage. The running (active) configuration file is stored here. ■ Flash memory: Either a chip inside the switch or a removable memory card, flash mem- ory stores fully functional Cisco IOS images and is the default location where the switch gets its Cisco IOS at boot time. Flash memory also can be used to store any other files, including backup copies of configuration files. ■ ROM: Read-only memory (ROM) stores a bootstrap (or boothelper) program that is loaded when the switch first powers on. This bootstrap program then finds the full Cisco IOS image and manages the process of loading Cisco IOS into RAM, at which point Cisco IOS takes over operation of the switch. ■ NVRAM: Nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) stores the initial or startup configuration file that is used when the switch is first powered on and when the switch is reloaded. Figure 6-9 summarizes this same information in a briefer and more convenient form for memorization and study. 142 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide RAM (Working Memory and Running Configuration) Flash (Cisco IOS Software) ROM (Bootstrap Program) NVRAM (Startup Configuration) Figure 6-9 Cisco Switch Memory Types Cisco IOS stores the collection of configuration commands in a configuration file. In fact, switches use multiple configuration files—one file for the initial configuration used when powering on, and another configuration file for the active, currently used running configu- ration as stored in RAM. Table 6-5 lists the names of these two files, their purpose, and their storage location . Table 6-5 Names and Purposes of the Two Main Cisco IOS Configuration Files Configuration Filename Purpose Where It Is Stored startup-config Stores the initial configuration used anytime the switch reloads Cisco IOS. NVRAM running-config Stores the currently used configuration commands. This file changes dynamically when someone enters commands in configuration mode. RAM Essentially, when you use configuration mode, you change only the running-config file. This means that the configuration example earlier in this chapter (Example 6-4) updates only the running-config file. However, if the switch lost power right after that example, all that configuration would be lost. If you want to keep that configuration, you have to copy the running-config file into NVRAM, overwriting the old startup-config file. Example 6-5 demonstrates that commands used in configuration mode change only the run- ning configuration in RAM. The example shows the following concepts and steps: Step 1. The example begins with both the running and startup-config having the same hostname, per the hostname hannah command. Step 2. The hostname is changed in configuration mode using the hostname jessie command. Step 3. The show running-config and show startup-config commands show the fact that the hostnames are now different, with the hostname jessie command found only in the running-config. Example 6-5 How Configuration Mode Commands Change the Running-Config File, Not the Startup-Config File ! Step 1 next (two commands) ! hannah# show running-config ! (lines omitted) hostname hannah ! (rest of lines omitted) Chapter 6: Using the Command-Line Interface 143 6 hannah# show startup-config ! (lines omitted) hostname hannah ! (rest of lines omitted) ! Step 2 next. Notice that the command prompt changes immediately after ! the hostname command. hannah# configure terminal hannah(config)# hostname jessie jessie(config)# exit ! Step 3 next (two commands) ! jessie# show running-config ! (lines omitted) – just showing the part with the hostname command hostname jessie ! jessie# show startup-config ! (lines omitted) – just showing the part with the hostname command hostname hannah Copying and Erasing Configuration Files The configuration process updates the running-config file, which is lost if the router loses power or is reloaded. Clearly, IOS needs to provide us a way to copy the running config- uration so that it will not be lost, so it will be used the next time the switch reloads or powers on. For instance, Example 6-5 ended with a different running configuration (with the hostname jessie command) versus the startup configuration. In short, the EXEC command copy running-config startup-config backs up the running- config to the startup-config file. This command overwrites the current startup-config file with what is currently in the running-configuration file. In addition, in lab, you may want to just get rid of all existing configuration and start over with a clean configuration. To do that, you can erase the startup-config file using three dif- ferent commands: write erase erase startup-config erase nvram: Once the startup-config file is erased, you can reload or power off/on the switch, and it will boot with the now-empty startup configuration. Note that Cisco IOS does not have a command that erases the contents of the running- config file. To clear out the running-config file, simply erase the startup-config file, and then reload the switch, and the running-config will be empty at the end of the process. NOTE Cisco uses the term reload to refer to what most PC operating systems call reboot- ing or restarting. In each case, it is a re-initialization of the software. The reload EXEC com- mand causes a switch to reload. 144 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Chapter Review One key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

CHAPTER 7 Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching This chapter covers the following exam topics: 2.0 LAN Switching Technologies 2.1 Describe and verify switching concepts 2.1.a MAC learning and aging 2.1.b Frame switching 2.1.c Frame flooding 2.1.d MAC address table When you buy a Cisco Catalyst Ethernet switch, the switch is ready to work. All you have to do is take it out of the box, power on the switch by connecting the power cable to the switch and a power outlet, and connect hosts to the switch using the correct unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cables. You do not have to configure anything else, you do not have to connect to the console and login, or do anything: the switch just starts for- warding Ethernet frames. In Part II of this book, you will learn how to build, configure, and verify the operation of Ethernet LANs. In Chapter 6, “Using the Command-Line Interface,” you learned some skills so you know how to connect to a switch’s CLI, move around in the CLI, issue commands, and configure the switch. The next step—this chapter—takes a short but important step in that journey by explaining the logic a switch uses when forwarding Ethernet frames. This chapter has two major sections. The first reviews the concepts behind LAN switch- ing, which were first introduced back in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs.” The second section of this chapter then uses IOS show commands to verify that Cisco switches actually learned the MAC addresses, built its MAC address table, and forwarded frames. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter. The answers are at the bottom of the page following the quiz, and the explanations are in DVD Appendix C and in the PCPT software.

The three listed MAC addresses were learned based on the destination MAC address of frames forwarded by the switch. d. 02CC.CCCC.CCCC was learned from the source MAC address of a frame that entered port Gi0/3. Foundation Topics LAN Switching Concepts A modern Ethernet LAN connects user devices as well as servers into some switches, with the switches then connecting to each other, sometimes in a design like Figure 7-1. Part of the LAN, called a campus LAN, supports the end user population as shown on the left of the figure. End user devices connect to LAN switches, which in turn connect to other switches so that a path exists to the rest of the network. The campus LAN switches sit in wiring clos- ets close to the end users. On the right, the servers used to provide information to the users also connects to the LAN. Those servers and switches often sit in a closed room called a data center, with connections to the campus LAN to support traffic to/from the users. Chapter 7: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching 149 7 Campus LAN Data Center LAN Figure 7-1 Campus LAN and Data Center LAN, Conceptual Drawing To forward traffic from a user device to a server and back, each switch performs the same kind of logic, independently from each other. The first half of this chapter examines the logic: how a switch chooses to forward an Ethernet frame, when the switch chooses to not forward the frame, and so on. Overview of Switching Logic Ultimately , the role of a LAN switch is to forward Ethernet frames. LANs exist as a set of user devices, servers, and other devices that connect to switches, with the switches con- nected to each other. The LAN switch has one primary job: to forward frames to the correct destination (MAC) address. And to achieve that goal, switches use logic—logic based on the source and destination MAC address in each frame’s Ethernet header. Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 A 2 C 3 A 4 B 5 C 6 D 150 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide LAN switches receive Ethernet frames and then make a switching decision: either forward the frame out some other ports or ignore the frame. To accomplish this primary mission, switches perform three actions: 1. Deciding when to forward a frame or when to filter (not forward) a frame, based on the destination MAC address 2. Preparing to forward frames by learning MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of each frame received by the switch 3. Preparing to forward only one copy of the frame to the destination by creating a (Layer 2) loop-free environment with other switches by using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) The first action is the switch’s primary job, whereas the other two items are overhead functions. NOTE Throughout this book’s discussion of LAN switches, the terms switch port and switch interface are synonymous. Although Chapter 2’s section titled “Ethernet Data-Link Protocols” already discussed the frame format, this discussion of Ethernet switching is pretty important, so reviewing the Ethernet frame at this point might be helpful. Figure 7-2 shows one popular format for an Ethernet frame. Basically, a switch would take the frame shown in the figure, make a deci- sion of where to forward the frame, and send the frame out that other interface. Header Trailer Destination 6 Type 2 Data and Pad 46 –1500 FCS 4 SFD 1 Source 6 Preamble 7 Figure 7-2 IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Frame (One Variation) Most of the upcoming discussions and figures about Ethernet switching focuses on the use of the destination and source MAC address fields in the header. All Ethernet frames have both a destination and source MAC address. Both are 6-bytes long (represented as 12 hex digits in the book), and are a key part of the switching logic discussed in this section. Refer back to Chapter 2’s discussion of the header in detail for more info on the rest of the Ethernet frame. NOTE The companion DVD and website include a video that explains the basics of Ethernet switching. Now on to the details of how Ethernet switching works! Forwarding Known Unicast Frames To decide whether to forward a frame, a switch uses a dynamically built table that lists MAC addresses and outgoing interfaces. Switches compare the frame’s destination MAC address to this table to decide whether the switch should forward a frame or simply ignore it. For exam- ple, consider the simple network shown in Figure 7-3, with Fred sending a frame to Barney.

The switch compares the destination MAC address (0200.2222.2222) to the MAC address table, matching the bold table entry. That matched table entry tells the switch to forward the frame out port F0/2, and only port F0/2. NOTE A switch’s MAC address table is also called the switching table, or bridging table, or even the Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) table, in reference to the type of physi- cal memory used to store the table. A switch’s MAC address table lists the location of each MAC relative to that one switch. In LANs with multiple switches, each switch makes an independent forwarding decision based on its own MAC address table. Together, they forward the frame so that it eventually arrives at the destination. For example, Figure 7-4 shows the first switching decision in a case in which Fred sends a frame to Wilma, with destination MAC 0200.3333.3333. The topology has changed versus the previous figure, this time with two switches, and Fred and Wilma connected to two different switches. Figure 7-3 shows the first switch’s logic, in reaction to Fred sending the original frame. Basically, the switch receives the frame in port F0/1, finds the destination MAC (0200.3333.3333) in the MAC address table, sees the outgoing port of G0/1, so SW1 forwards the frame out its G0/1 port . 152 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide F0/2 Fred Barney 0200.2222.2222 F0/1 Dest 0200.2222.2222 G0/1 F0/4 F0/3 Wilma 0200.3333.3333 Betty 0200.4444.4444 MAC Address F0/1 F0/2 G0/1 G0/1 0200.1111.1111 0200.2222.2222 0200.3333.3333 0200.4444.4444 Output SW1 Address Table MAC Address G0/2 G0/2 F0/3 F0/4 0200.1111.1111 0200.2222.2222 0200.3333.3333 0200.4444.4444 Output SW2 Address Table G0/2 1) Frame Entered F0/1... 2) Destined for 0200.3333.3333… 3) MAC table entry lists G0/1… 4) Forward out G0/1 1 2 3 SW1 SW2 Figure 7-4 Forwarding Decision with Two Switches: First Switch That same frame next arrives at switch SW2, entering SW2’s G0/2 interface. As shown in Figure 7-5, SW2 uses the same logic steps, but using SW2’s table. The MAC table lists the forwarding instructions for that switch only. In this case, switch SW2 forwards the frame out its F0/3 port, based on SW2’s MAC address table.

Chapter 7: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching 153 7 The examples so far use switches that happen to have a MAC table with all the MAC addresses listed. As a result, the destination MAC address in the frame is known to the switch. The frames are called known unicast frames, or simply known unicasts, because the destination address is a unicast address, and the destination is known. As shown in these examples, switches forward known unicast frames out one port: the port as listed in the MAC table entry for that MAC address. Learning MAC Addresses Thankfully , the networking staff does not have to type in all those MAC table entries. Instead, the switches do their second main function: to learn the MAC addresses and inter- faces to put into its address table. With a complete MAC address table, the switch can make accurate forwarding and filtering decisions as just discussed. Switches build the address table by listening to incoming frames and examining the source MAC address in the frame. If a frame enters the switch and the source MAC address is not in the MAC address table, the switch creates an entry in the table. That table entry lists the interface from which the frame arrived. Switch learning logic is that simple. Figure 7-6 depicts the same single-switch topology network as Figure 7-3, but before the switch has built any address table entries. The figure shows the first two frames sent in this network—first a frame from Fred, addressed to Barney, and then Barney’s response, addressed to Fred. F0/4 F0/3 Barney 0200.2222.2222 F0/2 F0/1 Wilma 0200.3333.3333 Betty 0200.4444.4444 1 1 2 F0/1 F0/2 2 Address: Output 0200.1111.1111 0200.2222.2222 Address Table: After Frame 2 (Barney to Fred) Address Table: Before Either Frame Is Sent F0/1 Address: Output 0200.1111.1111 Address Table: After Frame 1 (Fred to Barney) Fred 0200.1111.1111 (Empty) Address: Output (Empty) Figure 7-6 Switch Learning: Empty Table and Adding Two Entries (Figure 7-6 depicts the MAC learning process only, and ignores the forwarding process and therefore ignores the destination MAC addresses.) Focus on the learning process and how the MAC table grows at each step as shown on the right side of the figure. The switch begins with an empty MAC table, as shown in the upper right part of the figure. Then Fred sends his first frame (labeled “1”) to Barney, so the switch adds an entry for 0200.1111.1111, Fred’s MAC address, associated with interface F0/1. Why F0/1? The frame sent by Fred entered the switch’s F0/1 port. SW1’s logic runs some- thing like this: “The source is MAC 0200.1111.1111, the frame entered F0/1, so from my perspective, 0200.1111.1111 must be reachable out my port F0/1.” Continuing the example, when Barney replies in Step 2, the switch adds a second entry, this one for 0200.2222.2222, Barney’s MAC address, along with interface F0/2. Why F0/2? The 154 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide frame Barney sent entered the switch’s F0/2 interface. Learning always occurs by looking at the source MAC address in the frame, and adds the incoming interface as the associated port. Flooding Unknown Unicast and Broadcast Frames Now again turn your attention to the forwarding process, using the topology in Figure 7-5. What do you suppose the switch does with Fred’s first frame, the one that occurred when there were no entries in the MAC address table? As it turns out, when there is no matching entry in the table, switches forward the frame out all interfaces (except the incoming inter- face) using a process called flooding. And the frame whose destination address is unknown to the switch is called an unknown unicast frame, or simply an unknown unicast. Switches flood unknown unicast frames. Flooding means that the switch forwards copies of the frame out all ports, except the port on which the frame was received. The idea is simple: if you do not know where to send it, send it everywhere, to deliver the frame. And, by the way, that device will likely then send a reply—and then the switch can learn that device’s MAC address, and forward future frames out one port as a known unicast frame. Switches also flood LAN broadcast frames (frames destined to the Ethernet broadcast address of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF), because this process helps deliver a copy of the frame to all devices in the LAN. For example, Figure 7-7 shows the same first frame sent by Fred, when the switch’s MAC table is empty. At step 1, Fred sends the frame. At step 2, the switch sends a copy of the frame out all three of the other interfaces. F0/4 F0/3 Barney 0200.2222.2222 F0/2 F0/1 Wilma 0200.3333.3333 Betty 0200.4444.4444 1 2 2 Fred 0200.1111.1111 2 Address Table: Before Frame Is Sent (Empty) Address: Output (Empty) Figure 7-7 Switch Flooding: Unknown Unicast Arrives, Floods out Other Ports Avoiding Loops Using Spanning Tree Protocol The third primary feature of LAN switches is loop prevention, as implemented by Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). Without STP, any flooded frames would loop for an indefinite period of time in Ethernet networks with physically redundant links. To prevent looping frames, STP blocks some ports from forwarding frames so that only one active path exists between any pair of LAN segments. The result of STP is good: Frames do not loop infinitely, which makes the LAN usable. However, STP has negative features as well, including the fact that it takes some work to balance traffic across the redundant alternate links. A simple example makes the need for STP more obvious. Remember, switches flood unknown unicast frames and broadcast frames. Figure 7-8 shows an unknown unicast frame, Chapter 7: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching 155 7 sent by Larry to Bob, which loops forever because the network has redundancy but no STP. Note that the figure shows one direction of the looping frame only, just to reduce clutter, but a copy of the frame would also loop the other direction as well. Bob Powered Off! Archie Larry Frame Starts Here Figure 7-8 Network with Redundant Links but Without STP: The Frame Loops Forever The flooding of this frame would cause the frame to rotate around the three switches, because none of the switches list Bob’s MAC address in their address tables, each switch floods the frame. And while the flooding process is a good mechanism for forwarding unknown unicasts and broadcasts, the continual flooding of traffic frames as in the figure can completely congest the LAN to the point of making it unusable. A topology like Figure 7-8, with redundant links, is good, but we need to prevent the bad effect of those looping frames. To avoid Layer 2 loops, all switches need to use STP. STP causes each interface on a switch to settle into either a blocking state or a forwarding state. Blocking means that the interface cannot forward or receive data frames, while forwarding means that the interface can send and receive data frames. If a correct subset of the interfac- es is blocked, only a single currently active logical path exists between each pair of LANs. NOTE STP behaves identically for a transparent bridge and a switch. Therefore, the terms bridge, switch, and bridging device all are used interchangeably when discussing STP. The Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide book cov- ers the details of how STP prevents loops. LAN Switching Summary Switches use Layer 2 logic, examining the Ethernet data-link header to choose how to pro- cess frames. In particular, switches make decisions to forward and filter frames, learn MAC addresses, and use STP to avoid loops, as follows: Step 1. Switches forward frames based on the destination MAC address: A. If the destination MAC address is a broadcast, multicast, or unknown desti- nation unicast (a unicast not listed in the MAC table), the switch floods the frame. B. If the destination MAC address is a known unicast address (a unicast address found in the MAC table): i. If the outgoing interface listed in the MAC address table is different from the interface in which the frame was received, the switch for- wards the frame out the outgoing interface. 156 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide ii. If the outgoing interface is the same as the interface in which the frame was received, the switch filters the frame, meaning that the switch simply ignores the frame and does not forward it. Step 2. Switches use the following logic to learn MAC address table entries: A. For each received frame, examine the source MAC address and note the interface from which the frame was received. B. If it is not already in the table, add the MAC address and interface it was learned on. Step 3. Switches use STP to prevent loops by causing some interfaces to block, mean- ing that they do not send or receive frames. Verifying and Analyzing Ethernet Switching A Cisco Catalyst switch comes from the factory ready to switch frames. All you have to do is connect the power cable, plug in the Ethernet cables, and the switch starts switching incoming frames. Connect multiple switches together, and they are ready to forward frames between the switches as well. And the big reason behind this default behavior has to do with the default settings on the switches. Cisco Catalyst switches come ready to get busy switching frames because of settings like these: ■ The interfaces are enabled by default, ready to start working once a cable is connected. ■ All interfaces are assigned to VLAN 1. ■ 10/100 and 10/100/1000 interfaces use autonegotiation by default. ■ The MAC learning, forwarding, flooding logic all works by default. ■ STP is enabled by default. This second section of the chapter examines how switches will work with these default set- tings, showing how to verify the Ethernet learning and forwarding process. Demonstrating MAC Learning To see a switches MAC address table, use the show mac address-table command. With no additional parameters, this command lists all known MAC addresses in the MAC table, including some overhead static MAC addresses that you can ignore. To see all the dynamical- ly learned MAC addresses only, instead use the show mac address-table dynamic command. The examples in this chapter use almost no configuration, as if you just unboxed the switch when you first purchased it. For the examples, the switches have no configuration other than the hostname command to set a meaningful hostname. Note that to do this in lab, all I did was ■ Use the erase startup-config EXEC command to erase the startup-config file ■ Use the delete vlan.dat EXEC command to delete the VLAN configuration details ■ Use the reload EXEC command to reload the switch (thereby using the empty startup- config, with no VLAN information configured) ■ Configure the hostname SW1 command to set the switch hostname Chapter 7: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching 157 7 Once done, the switch starts forwarding and learning MAC address, as demonstrated in Example 7-1. Example 7-1 show mac address-table dynamic for Figure 7-7 SW1# show mac address-table dynamic Mac Address Table ------------------------------------------- Vlan Mac Address Type Ports ---- ----------- -------- ----- 1 0200.1111.1111 DYNAMIC Fa0/1 1 0200.2222.2222 DYNAMIC Fa0/2 1 0200.3333.3333 DYNAMIC Fa0/3 1 0200.4444.4444 DYNAMIC Fa0/4 Total Mac Addresses for this criterion: 4 SW1# First, focus on two columns of the table: the Mac Address and Ports columns of the table. The values should look familiar: they match the earlier single-switch example, as repeated here as Figure 7-9. Note the four MAC addresses listed, along with their matching ports, as shown in the figure. F0/4 F0/3 Barney 0200.2222.2222 F0/2 F0/1 Wilma 0200.3333.3333 Betty 0200.4444.4444 Fred 0200.1111.1111 Figure 7-9 Single Switch Topology Used in Verification Section Next, look at the Type field in the header. The column tells us whether the MAC address was learned by the switch as described earlier in this chapter. You can also statically pre- define MAC table entries using a couple of different features, including port security, and those would appear as Static in the Type column. Finally, the VLAN column of the output gives us a chance to briefly discuss how VLANs impact switching logic. LAN switches forward Ethernet frames inside a VLAN. What that means is if a frame enters via a port in VLAN 1, then the switch will forward or flood that frame out other ports in VLAN 1 only, and not out any ports that happen to be assigned to another VLAN. Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” looks at all the details of how switches forward frames when using VLANs. 158 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Switch Interfaces The first example assumes that you installed the switch and cabling correctly, and that the switch interfaces work. Once you do the installation and connect to the Console, you can easily check the status of those interfaces with the show interfaces status command, as shown in Example 7-2. Example 7-2 show interfaces status on Switch SW1 SW1# show interfaces status Port Name Status Vlan Duplex Speed Type Fa0/1 connected 1 a-full a-100 10/100BaseTX Fa0/2 connected 1 a-full a-100 10/100BaseTX Fa0/3 connected 1 a-full a-100 10/100BaseTX Fa0/4 connected 1 a-full a-100 10/100BaseTX Fa0/5 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/6 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/7 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/8 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/9 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/10 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/11 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/12 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/13 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/14 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/15 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/16 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/17 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/18 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/19 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/20 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/21 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/22 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/23 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Fa0/24 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100BaseTX Gi0/1 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100/1000BaseTX Gi0/2 notconnect 1 auto auto 10/100/1000BaseTX SW1# Focus on the port column for a moment. As a reminder, Cisco Catalyst switches name their ports based on the fastest specification supported, so in this case, the switch has 24 interfaces named Fast Ethernet, and two named Gigabit Ethernet. Many commands abbreviate those terms, this time as Fa for Fast Ethernet and Gi for Gigabit Ethernet. (The example happens to come from a Cisco Catalyst switch that has 24 10/100 ports and two 10/100/1000 ports.) The Status column of course tells us the status or state of the port. In this case, the lab switch had cables and devices connected to ports F0/1–F0/4 only, with no other cables connected. As a result, those first four ports have a state of connected, meaning that the Chapter 7: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching 159 7 ports have a cable and are functional. The notconnect state means that the port is not yet functioning. It may mean that there is no cable installed, but other problems may exist as well. (The section “Analyzing Switch Interface Status and Statistics,” in Chapter 12, “Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs,” works through the details of what causes a switch inter- face to fail.) NOTE You can see the status for a single interface in a couple of ways. For instance, for F0/1, the command show interfaces f0/1 status lists the status in a single line of output as in Example 7-2. The show interfaces f0/1 command (without the status keyword) displays a detailed set of messages about the interface. The show interfaces command has a large number of options. One particular option, the counters option, lists statistics about incoming and outgoing frames on the interfaces. In particular, it lists the number of unicast, multicast, and broadcast frames both the in and out direction, and a total byte count for those frames. Example 7-3 shows an example, again for interface F0/1 . Example 7-3 show interfaces f0/1 counters on Switch SW1 SW1# show interfaces f0/1 counters Port InOctets InUcastPkts InMcastPkts InBcastPkts Fa0/1 1223303 10264 107 18 Port OutOctets OutUcastPkts OutMcastPkts OutBcastPkts Fa0/1 3235055 13886 22940 437 Finding Entries in the MAC Address Table With a single switch and only four hosts connected to them, you can just read the details of the MAC address table and find the information you want to see. However, in real net- works, with lots of interconnected hosts and switches, just reading the output to find one MAC address can be hard to do. You might have hundreds of entries—page after page of output—with each MAC address looking like a random string of hex characters. (The MAC addresses used in the examples in this book are configured to make it easier to learn.) Thankfully, Cisco IOS supplies several more options on the show mac address-table com- mand to make it easier to find individual entries. First, if you know the MAC address, you can search for it—just type in the MAC address at the end of the command, as shown in Example 7-4. All you have to do is include the address keyword, followed by the actual MAC address. If the address exists, the output lists the address. Note that the output lists the exact same information in the exact same format, but it lists only the line for the match- ing MAC address. Example 7-4 show mac address-table dynamic with the address Keyword SW1# show mac address-table dynamic address 0200.1111.1111 Mac Address Table ------------------------------------------- 160 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Vlan Mac Address Type Ports ---- ----------- -------- ----- 1 0200.1111.1111 DYNAMIC Fa0/1 Total Mac Addresses for this criterion: 1 While useful, often times the engineer troubleshooting a problem does not know the MAC addresses of the devices connected to the network. Instead, the engineer has a topology diagram, knowing which switch ports connect to other switches and which connect to end- point devices. Sometimes you might be troubleshooting while looking at a network topology diagram, and want to look at all the MAC addresses learned off a particular port. IOS supplies that option with the show mac address-table dynamic interface command. Example 7-5 shows one example, for switch SW1’s F0/1 interface.

You guessed it—you can add the vlan parameter, followed by the VLAN number. Example 7-6 shows two such examples from the same switch SW1 from Figure 7-7—one for VLAN 1, where all four devices reside, and one for a non-existent VLAN 2.

Switches do learn MAC addresses, but those MAC addresses do not remain in the table indefinitely. The switch will remove the entries due to age, due to the table filling, and you can remove entries using a command. First, for aging out MAC table entries, switches remove entries that have not been used for a defined number of seconds (default of 300 seconds on many switches). To do that, switches look at every incoming frame, every source MAC address, and does something related to learning. If it is a new MAC address, the switch adds the correct entry to the table of course. However, if that entry already exists, the switch still does something: it resets the inactivity timer back to 0 for that entry. Each entry’s timer counts upward over time to mea- sure how long the entry has been in the table. The switch times out (removes) any entries whose timer reaches the defined aging time. Example 7-7 shows the aging timer setting for the entire switch. The aging time can be con- figured to a different time, globally and per-vlan. Example 7-7 The MAC Address Default Aging Timer Displayed SW1# show mac address-table aging-time Global Aging Time: 300 Vlan Aging Time ---- ---------- SW1# SW1# show mac address-table count Mac Entries for Vlan 1: --------------------------- Dynamic Address Count : 4 Static Address Count : 0 Total Mac Addresses : 4 Total Mac Address Space Available: 7299 Each switch also removes the oldest table entries, even if they are younger than the aging time setting, if the table fills. The MAC address table uses content-addressable memory (CAM), a physical memory that has great table lookup capabilities. However, the size of the table depends on the size of the CAM in a particular model of switch. When a switch tries to add a new table entry, and finds the table full, the switch times out (removes) the oldest table entry to make space. For perspective, the end of Example 7-7 lists the size of a Cisco Catalyst switch’s MAC table at about 8000 entries—the same four existing entries from the earlier examples, with space for 7299 more. 162 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Finally, you can remove the dynamic entries from the MAC address table with the clear mac address-table dynamic command. Note that the show commands in this chapter can be executed from user and enable mode, but the clear command happens to be a privileged mode command. MAC Address Tables with Multiple Switches Finally, to complete the discussion, it helps to think about an example with multiple switch- es, just to emphasize how MAC learning, forwarding, and flooding happens independently on each LAN switch. Consider the topology in Figure 7-10, and pay close attention to the port numbers. The ports were purposefully chosen so that neither switch used any of the same ports for this example. That is, switch SW2 does have a port F0/1 and F0/2, but I did not plug any devic- es into those ports when making this example. Also note that all ports are in VLAN 1, and as with the other examples in this chapter, all default configuration is used other than the hostname on the switches. F0/2 Fred 0200.1111.1111 Barney 0200.2222.2222 F0/1 G0/1 F0/4 F0/3 Wilma 0200.3333.3333 Betty 0200.4444.4444 G0/2 SW1 SW2 Figure 7-10 Two-Switch Topology Example Think about a case in which both switches learn all four MAC addresses. For instance, that would happen if the hosts on the left communicate with the hosts on the right. SW1’s MAC address table would list SW1’s own port numbers (F0/1, F0/2, and G0/1), because SW1 uses that information to decide where SW1 should forward frames. Similarly, SW2’s MAC table lists SW2’s port numbers (F0/3, F0/4, G0/2 in this example). Example 7-8 shows the MAC address tables on both switches for that scenario .

The first and most obvious, called the data plane, is the work a switch does to forward frames generated by the devices connected to the switch. In other words, the data plane is the main purpose of the switch. Second, the control plane refers to the configuration and processes that control and change the choices made by the switch’s data plane. The network engineer can control which interfaces are enabled and disabled, which ports run at which speeds, how Spanning Tree blocks some ports to prevent loops, and so on. The third category, the management plane, is the topic of this chapter. The management plane deals with managing the device itself, rather than controlling what the device is doing. In particular, this chapter looks at the most basic management features that can be config- ured in a Cisco switch. The first section of the chapter works through the configuration of different kinds of login security. The second section shows how to configure IPv4 settings on a switch so it can be remotely managed. The last (short) section then explains a few prac- tical matters that can make your life in lab a little easier. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter. The answers are at the bottom of the page following the quiz, and the explanations are in DVD Appendix C and in the PCPT software. Table 8-1 “Do I Know This Already?” Foundation Topics Section-to-Question Mapping Foundation Topics Section Questions Securing the Switch CLI 1–3 Enabling IP for Remote Access 4–5 Miscellaneous Settings Useful in Lab 6 1. Imagine that you have configured the enable secret command, followed by the enable password command, from the console. You log out of the switch and log back in at the console. Which command defines the password that you had to enter to access privileged mode? a. enable password b. enable secret c. Neither d. The password command, if it is configured 2. An engineer wants to set up simple password protection with no usernames for some switches in a lab, for the purpose of keeping curious co-workers from logging into the lab switches from their desktop PCs. Which of the following commands would be a useful part of that configuration? a. A login vty mode subcommand b. A password password console subcommand c. A login local vty subcommand d. A transport input ssh vty subcommand 3. An engineer had formerly configured a Cisco 2960 switch to allow Telnet access so that the switch expected a password of mypassword from the Telnet user.

The IP addressing plan shows that address 172.16.2.250 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch, and that 172.16.2.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH con- nections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.) a. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode. b.

The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1. 6. Which of the following line subcommands tells a switch to wait until a show com- mand’s output has completed before displaying log messages on the screen? a. logging synchronous b. no ip domain-lookup c. exec-timeout 0 0 d. history size 15 Foundation Topics Securing the Switch CLI By default, a Cisco Catalyst switch allows anyone to connect to the console port, access user mode, and then move on to enable and configuration modes without any kind of secu- rity. That default makes sense, given that if you can get to the console port of the switch, you already have control over the switch physically. However, everyone needs to operate switches remotely, and the first step in that process is to secure the switch so that only the appropriate users can access the switch command-line interface (CLI). This first topic in the chapter examines how to configure login security for a Cisco Catalyst switch. Securing the CLI includes protecting access to enable mode, because from enable mode, an attacker could reload the switch or change the configuration. Protecting user mode is also important, because attackers can see the status of the switch, learn about the network, and find new ways to attack the network. Note that all remote access and management protocols require that the switch IP configura- tion be completed and working. A switch’s IPv4 configuration has nothing to do with how a Layer 2 switch forwards Ethernet frames (as discussed in Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching”), but to Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH) to a switch, the switch needs to be configured with an IP address. This chapter also shows how to configure a switch’s IPv4 set- tings in the upcoming section “Enabling IPv4 for Remote Access.” Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management 169 8 In particular, this section covers the following login security topics: ■ Securing user mode and privileged mode with simple passwords ■ Securing user mode access with local usernames ■ Securing user mode access with external authentication servers ■ Securing remote access with Secure Shell (SSH) Securing User Mode and Privileged Mode with Simple Passwords Although the default switch configuration allows a console user to move into user mode and then privileged mode with no passwords required, unsurprisingly, the default settings prevent Telnet and SSH users from even accessing user mode. And while the defaults work well to prevent unwanted access when you first install the switch, you need to add some configuration to then be able to sit at your desk and log in to all the switches in the LAN. In addition, of course, you should not allow just anyone to log in and change the configura- tion, so some type of secure login should be used. The first option most people learn to secure access to user mode, one best used in a lab rather than in production, is a simple shared password. This method uses a password only— with no username—with one password for console users and a different password for Telnet users. Console users must supply the console password, as configured in console line configuration mode. Telnet users must supply the Telnet password, also called the vty password, so called because the configuration sits in vty line configuration mode. Figure 8-1 summarizes these options for using shared passwords from the perspective of the user log- ging into the switch. User Mode Enable Mode Console Password Enable Password vty Password 1 2 Figure 8-1 Simple Password Security Concepts NOTE This section refers to several passwords as shared passwords. These passwords are shared in the sense that when a new worker comes to the company, others must tell them (share) what the password is. In other words, each user does not have a unique username/ password to use, but rather, all the appropriate staff knows the passwords. In addition, Cisco switches protect enable mode (also called privileged mode) with yet another shared password called the enable password. From the perspective of the network engineer connecting to the CLI of the switch, once in user mode, the user types the enable EXEC command. This command prompts the user for this enable password; if the user types the correct password, IOS moves the user to enable mode.

Note that before this example began, the user started their terminal emulator, physically connected their laptop to the console cable, and then pressed the return key to make the switch respond as shown at the top of the example. Example 8-1 Configuring Basic Passwords and a Hostname (User now presses enter now to start the process. This line of text does not appear.) User Access Verification Password: hope Switch> enable Password: love Switch# Note that the example shows the password text as if typed (hope and love), along with the enable command that moves the user from user mode to enable mode. In reality, the switch hides the passwords when typed, to prevent someone from reading over your shoulder to see the password. To configure the shared passwords for the console, Telnet, and for enable mode, you need to configure several commands. However, the parameters of the commands can be pretty intuitive. Figure 8-2 shows the configuration of all three of these passwords. User Mode (switch>) Enable Mode (switch#) Console line console 0 login password hope line vty 0 15 login password love enable secret faith Telnet (vty) Figure 8-2 Simple Password Security Configuration The configuration for these three passwords does not require a lot of work. First, the con- sole and vty password configuration sets the password based on the context: console mode for the console ( line con 0), and vty line configuration mode for the Telnet password (line vty 0 15). Then inside console mode and vty mode, respectively, the two commands in each mode are login: Tells IOS to enable the use of a simple shared password (with no username) on this line (console or vty), so that the switch asks the user for a password password password-value: Defines the actual password used on the console or vty Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management 171 8 The configured enable password, shown on the right side of the figure, applies to all users, no matter whether they connect to user mode via the console, Telnet, or otherwise. The command to configure the enable password is a global configuration command: enable secret password-value. NOTE Older IOS versions used the command enable password password-value to set the enable password, and that command still exists in IOS. However, the enable secret command is much more secure. In real networks, use enable secret. Chapter 34, “Device Security Features,” explains more about the security levels of various password mechanisms, including a comparison of the enable secret and enable password commands. To help you follow the process, and for easier study later, use the configuration checklist before the example. The configuration checklist collects the required and optional steps to configure a feature as described in this book. The configuration checklist for shared pass- words for the console, Telnet, and enable passwords is Step 1. Configure the enable password with the enable secret password-value com- mand. Step 2. Configure the console password: A. Use the line con 0 command to enter console configuration mode. B. Use the login subcommand to enable console password security using a simple password. C. Use the password password-value subcommand to set the value of the console password. Step 3. Configure the Telnet (vty) password: A. Use the line vty 0 15 command to enter vty configuration mode for all 16 vty lines (numbered 0 through 15). B. Use the login subcommand to enable password security for vty sessions using a simple password. C. Use the password password-value subcommand to set the value of the vty password. Example 8-2 shows the configuration process as noted in the configuration checklist, along with setting the enable secret password. Note that the lines which begin with a ! are com- ment lines; they are there to guide you through the configuration. Example 8-2 Configuring Basic Passwords !

Securing User Mode Access with Local Usernames and Passwords Cisco switches support two other login security methods that both use per-user username/ password pairs instead of a shared password with no username. One method, referred to as local usernames and passwords, configures the username/password pairs locally—that is, in the switch’s configuration. Switches support this local username/password option for the console, for Telnet, and even for SSH, but do not replace the enable password used to reach enable mode. The configuration to migrate from using the simple shared passwords to instead use local usernames/passwords requires only some small configuration changes, as shown in Figure 8-3. User Mode (switch>) Console Telnet (vty) line console 0 login local password hope line vty 0 15 login local password love username wendell secret odom username chris secret youdda Figure 8-3 Configuring Switches to Use Local Username Login Authentication Working through the configuration in the figure, first, the switch of course needs to know the list of username/password pairs. To create these, repeatedly use the username name secret password global configuration command. Then, to enable this different type of console or Telnet security, simply enable this login security method with the login local line. Basically, this command means “use the local list of usernames for login.” You can also use the no password command (without even typing in the password) to clean up any 174 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide remaining password subcommands from console or vty mode, because these commands are not needed when using local usernames and passwords. The following checklist details the commands to configure local username login, mainly as a method for easier study and review: Step 1. Use the username name secret password global configuration command to add one or more username/password pairs on the local switch. Step 2. Configure the console to use locally configured username/password pairs: A. Use the line con 0 command to enter console configuration mode. B. Use the login local subcommand to enable the console to prompt for both username and password, checked versus the list of local usernames/pass- words. C. (Optional) Use the no password subcommand to remove any existing simple shared passwords, just for good housekeeping of the configuration file. Step 3. Configure Telnet (vty) to use locally configured username/password pairs. A. Use the line vty 0 15 command to enter vty configuration mode for all 16 vty lines (numbered 0 through 15). B. Use the login local subcommand to enable the switch to prompt for both username and password for all inbound Telnet users, checked versus the list of local usernames/passwords. C. (Optional) Use the no password subcommand to remove any existing sim- ple shared passwords, just for good housekeeping of the configuration file. When a Telnet user connects to the switch configured as shown in Figure 8-3, the user will be prompted first for a username and then for a password, as shown in Example 8-4. The username/password pair must be from the list of local usernames or the login is rejected.

NOTE The username secret command has an older less-secure cousin, the username password command. Chapter 34 explains more about the security levels of various password mechanisms. Today, use the more secure username secret command. Securing User Mode Access with External Authentication Servers The end of Example 8-4 points out one of the many security improvements when requir- ing each user to log in with their own username. The end of the example shows the user entering configuration mode (configure terminal), and then immediately leaving (end). Note that when a user exits configuration mode, the switch generates a log message. If the user logged in with a username, the log message identifies that username; note the “wendell” in the log message. However, using a username/password configured directly on the switch causes some admin- istrative headaches. For instance, every switch and router needs the configuration for all users who might need to log in to the devices. Then, when any changes need to happen, like an occasional change to the passwords for good security practices, the configuration of all devices must be changed. A better option would be to use tools like those used for many other IT login functions. Those tools allow for a central place to securely store all username/password pairs, with tools to make the user change their passwords regularly, tools to revoke users when they leave their current jobs, and so on. Cisco switches allow exactly that option using an external server called an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server . These servers hold the usernames/passwords. Typically, these servers allow users to do self service and forced maintenance to their pass- words. Many production networks use AAA servers for their switches and routers today. The underlying login process requires some additional work on the part of the switch for each user login, but once set up, the username/password administration is much less. When using a AAA server for authentication, the switch (or router) simply sends a message to the AAA server asking whether the username and password are allowed, and the AAA server replies. Figure 8-4 shows an example, with the user first supplying his username/password, the switch asking the AAA server, and the server replying to the switch stating that the user- name/password is valid. A S1 Login: wendell/odom1 Login: wendell/odom2 Command Prompt4 Approved! AAA3 SW1 RADIUS or TACACS+Telnet or SSH Figure 8-4 Basic Authentication Process with an External AAA Server 176 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide While the figure shows the general idea, note that the information flows with a couple of different protocols. On the left, the connection between the user and the switch or router uses Telnet or SSH. On the right, the switch and AAA server typically use either the RADIUS or TACACS+ protocol, both of which encrypt the passwords as they traverse the network. Securing Remote Access with Secure Shell So far, this chapter has focused on the console and on Telnet, mostly ignoring SSH. Telnet has one serious disadvantage: all data in the Telnet session flows as clear text, including the password exchanges. So, anyone that can capture the messages between the user and the switch (in what is called a man-in-the-middle attack) can see the passwords. SSH encrypts all data transmitted between the SSH client and server, protecting the data and passwords. SSH can use the same local login authentication method as Telnet, with the locally config- ured username and password. (SSH cannot rely on a password only.) So, the configuration to support local usernames for Telnet, as shown previously in Figure 8-3, also enables local username authentication for incoming SSH connections. Figure 8-5 shows one example configuration of what is required to support SSH. The figure repeats the local username configuration as shown earlier in Figure 8-3, as used for Telnet. Figure 8-5 shows three additional commands required to complete the configuration of SSH on the switch. username wendell secret odom username chris secret youdda ! line vty 0 15 login local hostname sw1 ip domain-name example.com ! Next Command Uses FQDN “sw1.example.com” crypto key generate rsa SSH-Specific Configuration Local Username Configuration (Like Telnet) User Mode (sw1>) SSH Figure 8-5 Adding SSH Configuration to Local Username Configuration IOS uses the three SSH-specific configuration commands in the figure to create the SSH encryption keys. The SSH server uses the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the switch as input to create that key. The term FQDN combines the hostname of a host and its domain name, in this case the hostname and domain name of the switch. Figure 8-5 begins by setting both values (just in case they are not already configured). Then the third com- mand, the crypto key generate rsa command, generates the SSH encryption keys. The configuration in Figure 8-5 relies on two default settings that the figure therefore con- veniently ignored. IOS runs an SSH server by default. In addition, IOS allows SSH connec- tions into the vty lines by default. Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management 177 8 Seeing the configuration happen in configuration mode, step by step, can be particularly helpful with SSH configuration. Note in particular that in this example, the crypto key com- mand prompts the user for the key modulus; you could also add the parameters modulus modulus-value to the end of the crypto key command to add this setting on the command. Example 8-5 shows the commands in Figure 8-5 being configured, with the encryption key as the final step.

However, because Telnet is a security risk, you could disable 178 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Telnet to enforce a tighter security policy. (For that matter, you can disable SSH support and allow Telnet on the vty lines as well.) To control which protocols a switch supports on its vty lines, use the transport input {all | none | telnet | ssh} vty subcommand in vty mode, with the following options: transport input all or transport input telnet ssh: Support both Telnet and SSH transport input none: Support neither transport input telnet: Support only Telnet transport input ssh: Support only SSH To complete this section about SSH, the following configuration checklist details the steps for one method to configure a Cisco switch to support SSH using local usernames. (SSH support in IOS can be configured in several ways; this checklist shows one simple way to configure it.) The process shown here ends with a comment to configure local username support on vty lines, as was discussed earlier in the section titled “Securing User Mode Access with Local Usernames and Passwords.” Step 1. Configure the switch to generate a matched public and private key pair to use for encryption: A. If not already configured, use the hostname name in global configuration mode to configure a hostname for this switch. B. If not already configured, use the ip domain-name name in global configu- ration mode to configure a domain name for the switch, completing the switch’s FQDN. C. Use the crypto key generate rsa command in global configuration mode (or the crypto key generate rsa modulus modulus-value command to avoid being prompted for the key modulus) to generate the keys. (Use at least a 768-bit key to support SSH version 2.) Step 2. (Optional) Use the ip ssh version 2 command in global configuration mode to override the default of supporting both versions 1 and 2, so that only SSHv2 connections are allowed. Step 3. (Optional) If not already configured with the setting you want, configure the vty lines to accept SSH and whether to also allow Telnet: A. Use the transport input ssh command in vty line configuration mode to allow SSH only. B. Use the transport input all command (default) or transport input telnet ssh command in vty line configuration mode to allow both SSH and Telnet. Step 4. Use various commands in vty line configuration mode to configure local user- name login authentication as discussed earlier in this chapter. NOTE Cisco routers default to transport input none, so that you must add the transport input line subcommand to enable Telnet and/or SSH into a router. Config Checklist Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management 179 8 Two key commands give some information about the status of SSH on the switch. First, the show ip ssh command lists status information about the SSH server itself. The show ssh command then lists information about each SSH client currently connected into the switch. Example 8-6 shows samples of each, with user Wendell currently connected to the switch. Example 8-6 Displaying SSH Status SW1# show ip ssh SSH Enabled - version 2.0 Authentication timeout: 120 secs; Authentication retries: 3 SW1# show ssh Connection Version Mode Encryption Hmac State Username 0 2.0 IN aes128-cbc hmac-sha1 Session started wendell 0 2.0 OUT aes128-cbc hmac-sha1 Session started wendell %No SSHv1 server connections running. Enabling IPv4 for Remote Access To allow Telnet or SSH access to the switch, and to allow other IP-based management protocols (for example, Simple Network Management Protocol, or SNMP) to function as intended, the switch needs an IP address, as well as a few other related settings. The IP address has nothing to do with how switches forward Ethernet frames; it simply exists to support overhead management traffic. This next topic begins by explaining the IPv4 settings needed on a switch, followed by the configuration. Note that although switches can be configured with IPv6 addresses with commands similar to those shown in this chapter, this chapter focuses solely on IPv4. All references to IP in this chapter imply IPv4. Host and Switch IP Settings A switch needs the same kind of IP settings as a PC with a single Ethernet interface. For perspective, a PC has a CPU, with the operating system running on the CPU. It has an Ethernet network interface card (NIC). The OS configuration includes an IP address asso- ciated with the NIC, either configured or learned dynamically with DHCP. A switch uses the same ideas, except that the switch needs to use a virtual NIC inside the switch. Like a PC, a switch has a real CPU, running an OS (called IOS). The switch obviously has lots of Ethernet ports, but instead of assigning its management IP address to any of those ports, the switch then uses a NIC-like concept called a switched virtual interface (SVI), or more commonly, a VLAN interface, that acts like the switch’s own NIC. Then the settings on the switch look something like a host, with the switch con- figuration assigning IP settings, like an IP address, to this VLAN interface, as shown in Figure 8-6. 180 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide VLAN 1 Subnet 192.168.1.0 Interface VLAN 1 (Shaded Area is Inside the Switch) interface vlan 1 ip address 192.168.1.8 255.255.255.0 Host Concept Inside Switch Other Real Hosts Outside Switch Figure 8-6 Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) Concept Inside a Switch By using interface VLAN 1 for the IP configuration, the switch can then send and receive frames on any of the ports in VLAN 1. In a Cisco switch, by default, all ports are assigned to VLAN 1. In most networks, switches configure many VLANs, so the network engineer has a choice of where to configure the IP address. That is, the management IP address does not have to be configured on the VLAN 1 interface (as configured with the interface vlan 1 command seen in Figure 8-6). A Layer 2 Cisco LAN switch often uses a single VLAN interface at a time, although multiple VLAN interfaces can be configured. The switch only needs one IP address for management purposes. But you can configure VLAN interfaces and assign them IP addresses for any working VLAN. For example, Figure 8-7 shows a Layer 2 switch with some physical ports in two different VLANs (VLANs 1 and 2). The figure also shows the subnets used on those VLANs. The net- work engineer could choose to create a VLAN 1 interface, a VLAN 2 interface, or both. In most cases, the engineer plans which VLAN to use when managing a group of switches, and creates a VLAN interface for that VLAN only. VLAN 1 Subnet 192.168.1.0 VLAN 2 Subnet 192.168.2.0 Interface VLAN 2 Interface VLAN 1 Which VLAN Should I Use for Management? ? (Shaded Area is Inside the Switch) Figure 8-7 Choosing One VLAN on Which to Configure a Switch IP Address Note that you should not try to use a VLAN interface for which there are no physical ports assigned to the same VLAN. If you do, the VLAN interface will not reach an up/up state, and the switch will not have the physical ability to communicate outside the switch. Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management 181 8 NOTE Some Cisco switches can be configured to act as either a Layer 2 switch or a Layer 3 switch. When acting as a Layer 2 switch, a switch forwards Ethernet frames as discussed in depth in Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching.” Alternatively, a switch can also act as a multilayer switch or Layer 3 switch, which means the switch can do both Layer 2 switching and Layer 3 IP routing of IP packets, using the Layer 3 logic normally used by routers. This chapter assumes all switches are Layer 2 switches. Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” further defines the differences between these types of operation for LAN switches. Configuring the IP address (and mask) on one VLAN interface allows the switch to send and receive IP packets with other hosts in a subnet that exists on that VLAN; however, the switch cannot communicate outside the local subnet without another configuration setting called the default gateway. The reason a switch needs a default gateway setting is the same reason that hosts need the same setting—because of how hosts think when sending IP pack- ets. Specifically: ■ To send IP packets to hosts in the same subnet, send them directly ■ To send IP packets to hosts in a different subnet, send them to the local router; that is, the default gateway Figure 8-8 shows the ideas. In this case, the switch (on the right) will use IP address 192.168.1.200 as configured on interface VLAN 1. However, to communicate with host A, on the far left of the figure, the switch must use Router R1 (the default gateway) to forward IP packets to host A. To make that work, the switch needs to configure a default gateway setting, pointing to Router R1’s IP address (192.168.1.1 in this case). Note that the switch and router both use the same mask, 255.255.255.0, which puts the addresses in the same subnet. VLAN 1 Subnet 192.168.1.0 Interface VLAN 1 (Shaded Area is Inside the Switch) R1 Other IPv4 Subnets A 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.200 (Default Gateway) Figure 8-8 The Need for a Default Gateway Configuring IPv4 on a Switch A switch configures its IPv4 address and mask on this special NIC-like VLAN interface. The following steps list the commands used to configure IPv4 on a switch, assuming that the IP address is configured to be in VLAN 1, with Example 8-7 that follows showing an example configuration. 182 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Step 1. Use the interface vlan 1 command in global configuration mode to enter interface VLAN 1 configuration mode. Step 2. Use the ip address ip-address mask command in interface configuration mode to assign an IP address and mask. Step 3. Use the no shutdown command in interface configuration mode to enable the VLAN 1 interface if it is not already enabled. Step 4. Add the ip default-gateway ip-address command in global configuration mode to configure the default gateway. Step 5. (Optional) Add the ip name-server ip-address1 ip-address2 … command in global configuration mode to configure the switch to use Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve names into their matching IP address. Example 8-7 Switch Static IP Address Configuration Emma# configure terminal Emma(config)# interface vlan 1 Emma(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.200 255.255.255.0 Emma(config-if)# no shutdown 00:25:07: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Vlan1, changed state to up 00:25:08: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Vlan1, changed state to up Emma(config-if)# exit Emma(config)# ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1 On a side note, this example shows a particularly important and common command: the [no] shutdown command. To administratively enable an interface on a switch, use the no shutdown interface subcommand; to disable an interface, use the shutdown interface subcommand. This command can be used on the physical Ethernet interfaces that the switch uses to switch Ethernet messages in addition to the VLAN interface shown here in this example. Also, pause long enough to look at the messages that appear just below the no shutdown command in Example 8-7. Those messages are syslog messages generated by the switch stat- ing that the switch did indeed enable the interface. Switches (and routers) generate syslog messages in response to a variety of events, and by default, those messages appear at the con- sole. Chapter 33, “Device Management Protocols,” discusses syslog messages in more detail. Configuring a Switch to Learn Its IP Address with DHCP The switch can also use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to dynamically learn its IPv4 settings. Basically, all you have to do is tell the switch to use DHCP on the interface, and enable the interface. Assuming that DHCP works in this network, the switch will learn all its settings. The following list details the steps, again assuming the use of interface VLAN 1, with Example 8-8 that follows showing an example: Step 1. Enter VLAN 1 configuration mode using the interface vlan 1 global configura- tion command, and enable the interface using the no shutdown command as necessary. Step 2. Assign an IP address and mask using the ip address dhcp interface subcommand. Config Checklist Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management 183 8 Example 8-8 Switch Dynamic IP Address Configuration with DHCP Emma# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. Emma(config)# interface vlan 1 Emma(config-if)# ip address dhcp Emma(config-if)# no shutdown Emma(config-if)# ^Z Emma# 00:38:20: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Vlan1, changed state to up 00:38:21: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Vlan1, changed state to up Verifying IPv4 on a Switch The switch IPv4 configuration can be checked in several places. First, you can always look at the current configuration using the show running-config command. Second, you can look at the IP address and mask information using the show interfaces vlan x command, which shows detailed status information about the VLAN interface in VLAN x. Finally, if using DHCP, use the show dhcp lease command to see the (temporarily) leased IP address and other parameters. (Note that the switch does not store the DHCP-learned IP configura- tion in the running-config file.) Example 8-9 shows sample output from these commands to match the configuration in Example 8-8. Example 8-9 Verifying DHCP-Learned Information on a Switch Emma# show dhcp lease Temp IP addr: 192.168.1.101 for peer on Interface: Vlan1 Temp sub net mask: 255.255.255.0 DHCP Lease server: 192.168.1.1, state: 3 Bound DHCP transaction id: 1966 Lease: 86400 secs, Renewal: 43200 secs, Rebind: 75600 secs Temp default-gateway addr: 192.168.1.1 Next timer fires after: 11:59:45 Retry count: 0 Client-ID: cisco-0019.e86a.6fc0-Vl1 Hostname: Emma Emma# show interfaces vlan 1 Vlan1 is up, line protocol is up Hardware is EtherSVI, address is 0019.e86a.6fc0 (bia 0019.e86a.6fc0) Internet address is 192.168.1.101/24 MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000000 Kbit, DLY 10 usec, reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255 ! lines omitted for brevity Emma# show ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1 The output of the show interfaces vlan 1 command lists two very important details related to switch IP addressing. First, this show command lists the interface status of the VLAN 1 interface—in this case, “up and up.” If the VLAN 1 interface is not up, the switch cannot use its IP address to send and receive management traffic. Notably, if you forget to issue 184 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide the no shutdown command, the VLAN 1 interface remains in its default shutdown state and is listed as “administratively down” in the show command output. Second, note that the output lists the interface’s IP address on the third line. If you statically configure the IP address, as in Example 8-7, the IP address will always be listed; however, if you use DHCP and DHCP fails, the show interfaces vlan x command will not list an IP address here. When DHCP works, you can see the IP address with the show interfaces vlan 1 command, but that output does not remind you whether the address is either statically configured or DHCP leased. So it does take a little extra effort to make sure you know whether the address is statically configured or DHCP-learned on the VLAN interface. Miscellaneous Settings Useful in Lab This last short section of the chapter touches on a couple of commands that can help you be a little more productive when practicing in a lab. History Buffer Commands When you enter commands from the CLI, the switch saves the last several commands in the history buffer. Then, as mentioned in Chapter 6, “Using the Command-Line Interface,” you can use the up-arrow key or press Ctrl+P to move back in the history buffer to retrieve a command you entered a few commands ago. This feature makes it very easy and fast to use a set of commands repeatedly. Table 8-2 lists some of the key commands related to the his- tory buffer. Table 8-2 Commands Related to the History Buffer Command Description show history An EXEC command that lists the commands currently held in the history buffer. terminal history size x From EXEC mode, this command allows a single user to set, just for this one login session, the size of his or her history buffer. history size x A configuration command that from console or vty line configuration mode, sets the default number of commands saved in the history buffer for the users of the console or vty lines, respectively. The logging synchronous, exec-timeout, and no ip domain-lookup Commands These next three configuration commands have little in common, other than the fact that they can be useful settings to reduce your frustration when using the console of a switch or router. The console automatically receives copies of all unsolicited syslog messages on a switch. The idea is that if the switch needs to tell the network administrator some important and possibly urgent information, the administrator might be at the console and might notice the message. Unfortunately, IOS (by default) displays these syslog messages on the console’s screen at any time—including right in the middle of a command you are entering, or in the middle of the output of a show command. Having a bunch of text show up unexpectedly can be a bit annoying. Chapter 8: Configuring Basic Switch Management 185 8 You could simply disable the feature that sends these messages to the console, and then re-enable the feature later, using the no logging console and logging console global commands. For example, when working from the console, if you want to temporarily not be bothered by log messages, you can disable the display of these messages with the no logging console global configuration command, and then when finished, enable them again. However, IOS supplies a reasonable compromise, telling the switch to display syslog mes- sages only at more convenient times, such as at the end of output from a show command. To do so, just configure the logging synchronous console line subcommand, which basi- cally tells IOS to synchronize the syslog message display with the messages requested using show commands. Another way to improve the user experience at the console is to control timeouts of the login session from the console or when using Telnet or SSH. By default, the switch auto- matically disconnects console and vty (Telnet and SSH) users after 5 minutes of inactivity. The exec-timeout minutes seconds line subcommand enables you to set the length of that inactivity timer. In lab (but not in production), you might want to use the special value of 0 minutes and 0 seconds meaning “never time out.” Finally, IOS has an interesting combination of features that can make you wait for a min- ute or so when you mistype a command. First, IOS tries to use DNS name resolution on IP hostnames—a generally useful feature. If you mistype a command, however, IOS thinks you want to Telnet to a host by that name. With all default settings in the switch, the switch tries to resolve the hostname, cannot find a DNS server, and takes about a minute to time- out and give you control of the CLI again. To avoid this problem, configure the no ip domain-lookup global configuration command, which disables IOS’s attempt to resolve the hostname into an IP address. Example 8-10 collects all these commands into a single example, as a template for some good settings to add in a lab switch to make you more productive. Example 8-10 Commands Often Used in Lab to Increase Productivity no ip domain-lookup ! line console 0 exec-timeout 0 0 logging synchronous history size 20 ! line vty 0 15 exec-timeout 0 0 logging synchronous history size 20 186 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Chapter Review One key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

So far in this part, you have learned the skills to navigate the command-line interface (CLI) and use commands that configure and verify switch features. You learned about the primary purpose of a switch—forwarding Ethernet frames—and learned how to see that process in action by looking at the switch MAC address table. After learning about the switch data plane in Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching,” you learned a few management plane features in Chapter 8, “Configuring Basic Switch Management,” like how to configure the switch to support Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH) by configuring IP address and login security. In this final chapter of Part II, you pick up tools that loosely fit in the switch control plane. First, this chapter shows how you can configure and change the operation of switch inter- faces: how to change the speed, duplex, or even disable the interface. The second half then shows how to add a security feature called port security, which monitors the source MAC address of incoming frames, deciding which frames are allowed and which cause a security violation. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Foundation Topics Configuring Switch Interfaces IOS uses the term interface to refer to physical ports used to forward data to and from other devices. Each interface can be configured with several settings, each of which might differ from interface to interface. IOS uses interface subcommands to configure these set- tings. Each of these settings may be different from one interface to the next, so you would first identify the specific interface, and then configure the specific setting. This section begins with a discussion of three relatively basic per-interface settings: the port speed, duplex, and a text description. Following that, the text takes a short look at a pair of the most common interface subcommands: the shutdown and no shutdown commands, which administratively disable and enable the interface, respectively. This section ends with a discussion about autonegotiation concepts, which in turn dictates what settings a switch chooses to use when using autonegotiation. Chapter 9: Configuring Switch Interfaces 193 9 Configuring Speed, Duplex, and Description Switch interfaces that support multiple speeds (10/100 and 10/100/1000 interfaces), by default, will autonegotiate what speed to use. However, you can configure the speed and duplex settings with the duplex {auto | full | half} and speed {auto | 10 | 100 | 1000} inter- face subcommands. Simple enough. Most of the time, using autonegotiation makes good sense, so when you set the duplex and speed, you typically have a good reason to do so. For instance, maybe you want to set the speed to the fastest possible on links between switches just to avoid the chance that auto- negotiation chooses a slower speed. The description text interface subcommand lets you add a text description to the interface. For instance, if you have good reason to configure the speed and duplex on a port, maybe add a description that says why you did. Example 9-1 shows how to configure duplex and speed, as well as the description command, which is simply a text description that can be configured by the administrator. Example 9-1 Configuring speed, duplex, and description on Switch Emma Emma# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. Emma(config)# interface FastEthernet 0/1 Emma(config-if)# duplex full Emma(config-if)# speed 100 Emma(config-if)# description Printer on 3rd floor, Preset to 100/full is connected here Emma(config-if)# exit Emma(config)# interface range FastEthernet 0/11 - 20 Emma(config-if-range)# description end-users connect here Emma(config-if-range)# ^Z Emma# First, focus on the mechanics of moving around in configuration mode again by looking closely at the command prompts. The various interface commands move the user from global mode into interface configuration mode for a specific interface. For instance, the example configures the duplex, speed, and description commands all just after the interface FastEthernet 0/1 command, which means that all three of those configuration settings apply to interface Fa0/1, and not to the other interfaces. The show interfaces status command lists much of the detail configured in Example 9-1, even with only one line of output per interface. Example 9-2 shows an example, just after the configuration in Example 9-1 was added to the switch.

It also lists the configured speed of 100 and duplex full per the speed and duplex commands in Example 9-1. However, it also states that Fa0/1 has a status of not- connect, meaning that the interface is not currently working. (That switch port did not have a cable connected when collecting this example, on purpose.) FastEthernet 0/2 (Fa0/2): Example 9-1 did not configure this port at all. This port had all default configuration. Note that the “auto” text under the speed and duplex heading means that this port will attempt to autonegotiate both settings when the port comes up. However, this port also does not have a cable connected (again on purpose, for comparison). FastEthernet 0/4 (Fa0/4): Like Fa0/2, this port has all default configuration, but was cabled to another working device to give yet another contrasting example. This device completed the autonegotiation process, so instead of “auto” under the speed and duplex headings, the output lists the negotiated speed and duplex (a-full and a-100). Note that the text includes the a- to mean that the listed speed and duplex values were autonegotiated. Chapter 9: Configuring Switch Interfaces 195 9 Configuring Multiple Interfaces with the interface range Command The bottom of the configuration in Example 9-1 shows a way to shorten your configuration work when making the same setting on multiple consecutive interfaces. To do so, use the interface range command. In the example, the interface range FastEthernet 0/11 - 20 com- mand tells IOS that the next subcommand(s) apply to interfaces Fa0/11 through Fa0/20. You can define a range as long as all interfaces are the same type and are numbered consecutively. NOTE This book spells out all parameters fully to avoid confusion. However, most every- one abbreviates what they type in the CLI to the shortest unique abbreviation. For instance, the configuration commands int f0/1 and int ran f0/11 - 20 would also be acceptable. IOS does not actually put the interface range command into the configuration. Instead, it acts as if you had typed the subcommand under every single interface in the specified range. Example 9-3 shows an excerpt from the show running-config command, listing the configuration of interfaces F0/11–12 from the configuration in Example 9-1. The example shows the same description command on both interfaces; to save space the example did not bother to show all 10 interfaces that have the same description text. Example 9-3 How IOS Expands the Subcommands Typed After interface range Emma# show running-config ! Lines omitted for brevity interface FastEthernet0/11 description end-users connect here ! interface FastEthernet0/12 description end-users connect here ! Lines omitted for brevity Administratively Controlling Interface State with shutdown As you might imagine, network engineers need a way to bring down an interface without having to travel to the switch and remove a cable. In short, we need to be able to decide which ports should be enabled, and which should be disabled. In an odd turn of phrase, Cisco uses two interface subcommands to configure the idea of administratively enabling and disabling an interface: the shutdown command (to disable), and the no shutdown command (to enable). While the no shutdown command might seem like an odd command to enable an interface at first, you will use this command a lot in lab, and it will become second nature. (Most people in fact use the abbreviations shut and no shut.) Example 9-4 shows an example of disabling an interface using the shutdown interface sub- command. In this case, switch SW1 has a working interface F0/1. The user connects at the console and disables the interface. IOS generates a log message each time an interface fails or recovers, and log messages appear at the console, as shown in the example. Example 9-4 Administratively Disabling an Interface with shutdown SW1# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. 196 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide SW1(config)# interface fastEthernet 0/1 SW1(config-if)# shutdown SW1(config-if)# *Mar 2 03:02:19.701: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to administratively down *Mar 2 03:02:20.708: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to down To bring the interface back up again, all you have to do is follow the same process but use the no shutdown command instead. Before leaving the simple but oddly named shutdown/no shutdown commands, take a look at two important show commands that list the status of a shutdown interface. The s how interfaces status command lists one line of output per interface, and when shut down, lists the interface status as “disabled.” That makes logical sense to most people. The show interfaces command (without the status keyword) lists many lines of output per interface, giving a much more detailed picture of interface status and statistics. With that command, the interface status comes in two parts, with one part using the phrase “administratively down,” matching the highlighted log message in Example 9-4. Example 9-5 shows an example of each of these commands. Note that both examples also use the F0/1 parameter (short for Fast Ethernet0/1), which limits the output to the messages about F0/1 only. Also note that F0/1 is still shut down at this point.

In some cases, the commands are not the end goal, and the text is attempt- ing to teach you something about how the CLI works. This next short topic is more about the process than about the commands. With some IOS configuration commands (but not all), you can revert to the default set- ting by issuing a no version of the command. What does that mean? Let me give you a few examples: ■ If you earlier had configured speed 100 on an interface, the no speed command on that same interface reverts to the default speed setting (which happens to be speed auto). ■ Same idea with the duplex command: an earlier configuration of duplex half or duplex full, followed by no duplex on the same interface, reverts the configuration back to the default of duplex auto. ■ If you had configured a description command with some text, to go back to the default state of having no description command at all for that interface, use the no description command. Example 9-6 shows the process. In this case, switch SW1’s F0/2 port has been configured with speed 100, duplex half, description link to 2901-2, and shutdown. You can see evidence of all four settings in the command that begins the example. (This command lists the running-config, but only the part for that one interface.) The example then shows the no versions of those commands, and closes with a confirmation that all the commands have reverted to default.

Autonegotiation For any 10/100 or 10/100/1000 interfaces—that is, interfaces that can run at different speeds—Cisco Catalyst switches default to a setting of duplex auto and speed auto. As a result, those interfaces attempt to automatically determine the speed and duplex setting to use. Alternatively, you can configure most devices, switch interfaces included, to use a spe- cific speed and/or duplex. In practice, using autonegotiation is easy: just leave the speed and duplex at the default set- ting, and let the switch port negotiate what settings to use on each port. However, problems can occur due to unfortunate combinations of configuration. Therefore, this next topic walks through more detail about the concepts behind autonegotiation, so you know better how to interpret the meaning of the switch show commands and when to choose to use a particular configuration setting. Autonegotiation Under Working Conditions Ethernet devices on the ends of a link must use the same standard or they cannot correctly send data. For example, a NIC cannot use 100BASE-T, which uses a two-pair UTP cable with a 100-Mbps speed, while the switch port on the other end of the link uses 1000BASE-T. Even if you used a cable that works with Gigabit Ethernet, the link would not work with one end trying to send at 100 Mbps while the other tried to receive the data at 1000 Mbps. Chapter 9: Configuring Switch Interfaces 199 9 Upgrading to new and faster Ethernet standards becomes a problem because both ends have to use the same standard. For example, if you replace an old PC with a new one, the old one might have been using 100BASE-T while the new one uses 1000BASE-T. The switch port on the other end of the link needs to now use 1000BASE-T, so you upgrade the switch. If that switch had ports that would use only 1000BASE-T, you would need to upgrade all the other PCs connected to the switch. So, having both PC network interface cards (NIC) and switch ports that support multiple standards/speeds makes it much easier to migrate to the next better standard. The IEEE autonegotiation protocol helps makes it much easier to operate a LAN when NICs and switch ports support multiple speeds. IEEE autonegotiation (IEEE standard 802.3u) defines a protocol that lets the two UTP-based Ethernet nodes on a link negotiate so that they each choose to use the same speed and duplex settings. The protocol messages flow outside the normal Ethernet electrical frequencies as out-of-band signals over the UTP cable. Basically, each node states what it can do, and then each node picks the best options that both nodes support: the fastest speed and the best duplex setting, with full duplex being better than half duplex. NOTE Autonegotiation relies on the fact that the IEEE uses the same wiring pinouts for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T, and that 1000BASE-T simply adds to those pinouts, adding two pairs. Many networks use autonegotiation every day, particularly between user devices and the access layer LAN switches, as shown in Figure 9-1. The company installed four-pair cabling of the right quality to support 1000BASE-T, to be ready to support Gigabit Ethernet. As a result, the wiring supports 10-Mbps, 100-Mbps, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet options. Both nodes on each link send autonegotiation messages to each other. The switch in this case has all 10/100/1000 ports, while the PC NICs support different options. Autonegotiation Enabled Autonegotiation Enabled, 10/100/1000 Ports 1 2 3 10 10/100 Result: 10 Full Result: 100 Full Result: 1000 Full 10/100/1000 10/100/100010/100/100010/100/1000 Figure 9-1 IEEE Autonegotiation Results with Both Nodes Working Correctly 200 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The following list breaks down the logic, one PC at a time: PC1: The switch port claims it can go as fast as 1000 Mbps, but PC1’s NIC claims a top speed of 10 Mbps. Both the PC and switch choose the best speed both support (10 Mbps) and the best duplex (full). PC2: PC2 claims a best speed of 100 Mbps, which means it can use 10BASE-T or 100BASE-T. The switch port and NIC negotiate to use the best speed of 100 Mbps and full duplex. PC3: It uses a 10/100/1000 NIC, supporting all three speeds and standards, so both the NIC and switch port choose 1000 Mbps and full duplex. Autonegotiation Results When Only One Node Uses Autonegotiation Figure 9-1 shows the IEEE autonegotiation results when both nodes use the process. However, most Ethernet devices can disable autonegotiation, so it is just as important to know what happens when a node tries to use autonegotiation but the node gets no response. Disabling autonegotiation is not always a bad idea. For instance, many network engineers disable autonegotiation on links between switches and simply configure the desired speed and duplex on both switches. However, mistakes can happen when one device on an Ethernet predefines speed and duplex (and disables autonegotiation), while the device on the other end attempts autonegotiation. In that case, the link might not work at all, or it might just work poorly. NOTE Configuring both the speed and duplex on a Cisco switch interface disables autonegotiation. IEEE autonegotiation defines some rules (defaults) that nodes should use as defaults when autonegotiation fails—that is, when a node tries to use autonegotiation but hears nothing from the device. The rules: ■ Speed: Use your slowest supported speed (often 10 Mbps). ■ Duplex: If your speed = 10 or 100, use half duplex; otherwise, use full duplex. Cisco switches can make a better choice than that base IEEE logic, because Cisco switches can actually sense the speed used by other nodes, even without IEEE autonegotiation. As a result, Cisco switches use this slightly different logic to choose the speed when autonegotia- tion fails: ■ Speed: Sense the speed (without using autonegotiation), but if that fails, use the IEEE default (slowest supported speed, often 10 Mbps). ■ Duplex: Use the IEEE defaults: If speed = 10 or 100, use half duplex; otherwise, use full duplex. Figure 9-2 shows three examples in which three users change their NIC settings and disable autonegotiation, while the switch (with all 10/100/1000 ports) attempts autonegotiation. That is, the switch ports all default to speed auto and duplex auto. The top of the figure shows the configured settings on each PC NIC, with the choices made by the switch listed next to each switch port. Chapter 9: Configuring Switch Interfaces 201 9 Manual Settings, Autonegotiation Disabled Autonegotiation Enabled, 10/100/1000 Ports 1 2 3 10/100 10/100/1000 Settings: 100 Full Settings: 1000 Full Settings: 10 Half Result: 100 HalfF0/1 F0/2 F0/3 Result: 1000 Full Result: 10 Half 10/100 Figure 9-2 IEEE Autonegotiation Results with Autonegotiation Disabled on One Side Reviewing each link, left to right: ■ PC1: The switch receives no autonegotiation messages, so it senses the electrical signal to learn that PC1 is sending data at 100 Mbps. The switch uses the IEEE default duplex based on the 100 Mbps speed (half duplex). ■ PC2: The switch uses the same steps and logic as with the link to PC1, except that the switch chooses to use full duplex because the speed is 1000 Mbps. ■ PC3: The user picks poorly, choosing the slower speed (10 Mbps) and the worse duplex setting (half). However, the Cisco switch senses the speed without using IEEE autonego- tiation and then uses the IEEE duplex default for 10-Mbps links (half duplex). PC1 shows a classic and unfortunately common end result: a duplex mismatch. The two nodes (PC1 and SW1’s port F0/1) both use 100 Mbps, so they can send data. However, PC1, using full duplex, does not attempt to use carrier sense multiple access with colli- sion detection (CSMA/CD) logic and sends frames at any time. Switch port F0/1, with half duplex, does use CSMA/CD. As a result, switch port F0/1 will believe collisions occur on the link, even if none physically occur. The switch port will stop transmitting, back off, resend frames, and so on. As a result, the link is up, but it performs poorly. Autonegotiation and LAN Hubs LAN hubs also impact how autonegotiation works. Basically, hubs do not react to autone- gotiation messages, and they do not forward the messages. As a result, devices connected to a hub must use the IEEE rules for choosing default settings, which often results in the devices using 10 Mbps and half duplex. Figure 9-3 shows an example of a small Ethernet LAN that uses a 20-year-old 10BASE-T hub. In this LAN, all devices and switch ports are 10/100/1000 ports. The hub supports only 10BASE-T. 202 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide 1000 Full Result: 10 Half 1000 Full Result: 10 Half Result: 10 Half SW1 Hub 1 1 2 3 4 Figure 9-3 IEEE Autonegotiation with a LAN Hub Note that the devices on the right need to use half duplex because the hub requires the use of the CSMA/CD algorithm to avoid collisions. Port Security If the network engineer knows what devices should be cabled and connected to particular interfaces on a switch, the engineer can use port security to restrict that interface so that only the expected devices can use it. This reduces exposure to attacks in which the attacker connects a laptop to some unused switch port. When that inappropriate device attempts to send frames to the switch interface, the switch can take different actions, ranging from sim- ply issuing informational messages to effectively shutting down the interface. Port security identifies devices based on the source MAC address of Ethernet frames the devices send. For example, in Figure 9-4, PC1 sends a frame, with PC1’s MAC address as the source address. SW1’s F0/1 interface can be configured with port security, and if so, SW1 would examine PC1’s MAC address and decide whether PC1 was allowed to send frames into port F0/1. F0/1 G0/1 G0/2 F0/2 Source = PC1 MAC 1 2 SW1Frame Source = PC2 MAC Frame SW2 Figure 9-4 Source MAC Addresses in Frames as They Enter a Switch Port security also has no restrictions on whether the frame came from a local device or was forwarded through other switches. For example, switch SW1 could use port security on its G0/1 interface, checking the source MAC address of the frame from PC2, when forwarded up to SW1 from SW2. Port security has several flexible options, but all operate with the same core concepts. First, switches enable port security per port, with different settings available per port. Each port has a maximum number of allowed MAC addresses, meaning that for all frames entering that port, only that number of different source MAC addresses can be used in different incoming frames before port security thinks a violation has occurred. When a frame with a new source MAC address arrives, pushing the number of MAC addresses past the allowed Chapter 9: Configuring Switch Interfaces 203 9 maximum, a port security violation occurs. At that point, the switch takes action—by default, discarding all future incoming traffic on that port. The following list summarizes these ideas common to all variations of port security: ■ Define a maximum number of source MAC addresses allowed for all frames coming in the interface. ■ Watch all incoming frames, and keep a list of all source MAC addresses, plus a counter of the number of different source MAC addresses. ■ When adding a new source MAC address to the list, if the number of MAC addresses pushes past the configured maximum, a port security violation has occurred. The switch takes action (the default action is to shut down the interface). Those rules define the basics, but port security allows other options as well, including let- ting you configure the specific MAC addresses allowed to send frames in an interface. For example, in Figure 9-4, switch SW1 connects through interface F0/1 to PC1, so the port security configuration could list PC1’s MAC address as the specific allowed MAC address. But predefining MAC addresses for port security is optional: You can predefine all MAC addresses, none, or a subset of the MAC addresses. You might like the idea of predefining the MAC addresses for port security, but finding the MAC address of each device can be a bother. Port security provides an easy way to discover the MAC addresses used off each port using a feature called sticky secure MAC addresses. With this feature, port security learns the MAC addresses off each port and stores them in the port security configuration (in the running-config file). This feature helps reduce the big effort of finding out the MAC address of each device. As you can see, port security has a lot of detailed options. The next few sections walk you through these options to pull the ideas together. Configuring Port Security Port security configuration involves several steps. First, you need to disable the negotiation of a feature that is not discussed until Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” whether the port is an access or trunk port. For now, accept that port security requires a port to be configured to either be an access port or a trunking port. The rest of the com- mands enable port security, set the maximum allowed MAC addresses per port, and config- ure the actual MAC addresses, as detailed in this list: Step 1. Make the switch interface either a static access or trunk interface using the switchport mode access or the switchport mode trunk interface subcom- mands, respectively. Step 2. Enable port security using the switchport port-security interface subcom- mand. Step 3. (Optional) Override the default maximum number of allowed MAC address- es associated with the interface (1) by using the switchport port-security maximum number interface subcommand. Step 4. (Optional) Override the default action to take upon a security violation (shutdown) using the switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict | shutdown} interface subcommand. Config Checklist 204 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Step 5. (Optional) Predefine any allowed source MAC addresses for this interface using the switchport port-security mac-address mac-address command. Use the command multiple times to define more than one MAC address. Step 6. (Optional) Tell the switch to “sticky learn” dynamically learned MAC addresses with the switchport port-security mac-address sticky interface subcommand. Figure 9-5 and Example 9-7 show four examples of port security. Three ports operate as access ports, while port F0/4, connected to another switch, operates as a trunk. Note that port security allows either a trunk or an access port, but requires that the port be statically set as one or the other.

Note that the first three interfaces in the example use the same first two interface subcommands, matching the first two configuration steps noted before Figure 9-5. The switchport port-security command enables port security, with all defaults, with the switchport mode access command meeting the requirement to configure the port as either an access or trunk port. The final port, F0/4, has a similar configuration, except that it has been configured as a trunk rather than as an access port. Next, scan all four interfaces again, and note that the configuration differs on each inter- face after those first two interface subcommands. Each interface simply shows a different example for perspective. The first interface, FastEthernet 0/1, adds one optional port security subcommand: switchport port-security mac-address 0200.1111.1111, which defines a specific source MAC address. With the default maximum source address setting of 1, only frames with source MAC 0200.1111.1111 will be allowed in this port. When a frame with a source other than 0200.1111.1111 enters F0/1, the switch will take the default violation action and disable the interface. As a second example, FastEthernet 0/2 uses the same logic as FastEthernet 0/1, except that it uses the sticky learning feature. For port F0/2, the configuration the switchport port-security mac-address sticky command, which tells the switch to dynamically learn source MAC addresses and add port-security commands to the running-config. The end of upcoming Example 9-8 shows the running-config file that lists the sticky-learned MAC address in this case. NOTE Port security does not save the configuration of the sticky addresses, so use the copy running-config startup-config command if desired. The other two interfaces do not predefine MAC addresses, nor do they sticky-learn the MAC addresses. The only difference between these two interfaces’ port security configura- tion is that FastEthernet 0/4 supports eight MAC addresses, because it connects to another switch and should receive frames with multiple source MAC addresses. Interface F0/3 uses the default maximum of one MAC address. Verifying Port Security Example 9-8 lists the output of two examples of the show port-security interface com- mand. This command lists the configuration settings for port security on an interface, plus it lists several important facts about the current operation of port security, including informa- tion about any security violations. The two commands in the example show interfaces F0/1 and F0/2, based on Example 9-7’s configuration.

The show port- security interface fastethernet 0/1 command shows that the interface is in a secure- shutdown state, which means that the interface has been disabled because of port security. In this case, another device connected to port F0/1, sending a frame with a source MAC address other than 0200.1111.1111, is causing a violation. However, port Fa0/2, which used sticky learning, simply learned the MAC address used by Server 2. The bottom of Example 9-8, as compared to the configuration in Example 9-7, shows the changes in the running-config because of sticky learning, with the switchport port-security mac-address sticky 0200.2222.2222 interface subcommand. Chapter 9: Configuring Switch Interfaces 207 9 Port Security Violation Actions Finally, the switch can be configured to use one of three actions when a violation occurs. All three options cause the switch to discard the offending frame, but some of the options make the switch take additional actions. The actions include the sending of syslog messages to the console, sending SNMP trap messages to the network management station, and dis- abling the interface. Table 9-2 lists the options of the switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict | shutdown} command and their meanings. Table 9-2 Actions When Port Security Violation Occurs Option on the switchport port-security violation Command Protect Restrict Shutdown* Discards offending traffic Yes Yes Yes Sends log and SNMP messages No Yes Yes Increments the violation counter for each violating incoming frame No Yes Yes Disables the interface by putting it in an err-disabled state, discarding all traffic No No Yes *shutdown is the default setting. Note that the shutdown option does not actually add the shutdown subcommand to the interface configuration. Instead, IOS puts the interface in an error disabled (err-disabled) state, which makes the switch stop all inbound and outbound frames. To recover from this state, someone must manually disable the interface with the shutdown interface command and then enable the interface with the no shutdown command. Port Security MAC Addresses as Static and Secure but Not Dynamic To complete this chapter, take a moment to think about Chapter 7’s discussions about switching, along with all those examples of output from the show mac address-table dynamic EXEC command. Once a switch port has been configured with port security, the switch no longer considers MAC addresses associated with that port as being dynamic entries as listed with the show mac address-table dynamic EXEC command. Even if the MAC addresses are dynamically learned, once port security has been enabled, you need to use one of these options to see the MAC table entries associated with ports using port security: ■ show mac address-table secure: Lists MAC addresses associated with ports that use port security ■ show mac address-table static: Lists MAC addresses associated with ports that use port security, as well as any other statically defined MAC addresses Example 9-9 proves the point. It shows two commands about interface F0/2 from the port security example shown in Figure 9-5 and Example 9-7. In that example, port security was configured on F0/2 with sticky learning, so from a literal sense, the switch learned a MAC address off that port (0200.2222.2222). However, the show mac address-table dynamic com- mand does not list the address and port, because IOS considers that MAC table entry to be a static entry. The show mac address-table secure command does list the address and port. 208 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Example 9-9 Using the secure Keyword to See MAC Table Entries When Using Port Security SW1# show mac address-table secure interface F0/2 Mac Address Table ------------------------------------------- Vlan Mac Address Type Ports ---- ----------- -------- ----- 1 0200.2222.2222 STATIC Fa0/2 Total Mac Addresses for this criterion: 1 SW1# show mac address-table dynamic interface f0/2 Mac Address Table ------------------------------------------- Vlan Mac Address Type Ports ---- ----------- -------- ----- SW1# Chapter Review One key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

Part II Review Review Key Topics Review all key topics in all chapters in this part, either by browsing the chapters or by using the Key Topics application on the DVD or companion website. Create Terminology Mind Maps Similar to the exercise you did in the Part I review, without looking back at the chapters or your notes, create a mind map with all the terminology you can recall from Part II of the book. Your job is as follows: ■ Think of every term that you can remember from Part II of the book. ■ Organize the terms into two divisions: Ethernet terms and CLI terms. (Do not include CLI commands, just terms [for example, enable mode].) ■ After you have written every term you can remember into one of the mind maps, review the Key Terms list at the end of Chapters 6 through 9. Add any terms you for- got to your mind maps. Create Command Mind Maps by Category Part II of this book introduced a large number of both configuration and EXEC commands. The sheer number of commands can be a bit overwhelming, so it helps to practice the pro- cess of remembering which commands exist and which ones work together for a particular feature. This mind map exercise focuses on that task. Create one mind map for each of the categories of commands in this list: Securing the console and Telnet with passwords, securing the console and Telnet with local usernames, SSH, switch IPv4 support, switch forwarding, port security, other switch admin, other interface subcommands For each category, think of all configuration commands and all EXEC commands (mostly show commands). For each category, group the configuration commands separately from the EXEC commands. Figure P2-1 shows a sample for IPv4 commands on a switch. Figure P2-1 Sample Mind Map from the Switch IPv4 Support Branch 214 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide NOTE For more information on mind mapping, refer to the Introduction, in the section “About Mind Maps.” Finally, keep the following important points in mind when working on this project: ■ Most of the learning with this exercise happens when you do it. Reading some other mind map, or just rereading command tables, does not work as well for helping you remember for yourself. ■ Do this activity without notes and without looking at the book. ■ After you finish, review it and compare it against the command summary tables at the ends of the chapters, and note which commands you had originally forgotten. ■ Do not worry about every last parameter or the exact syntax; just write down the first few words of the command. ■ For later study, make a note about which commands you feel you truly understand and which ones about which you feel less confident. ■ Repeat this exercise when you have 10 spare minutes, as a way to see what you remember (again without your notes).

This page intentionally left blank Part III of this book builds on the basics of implementing Ethernet in Part II by taking the concepts, configuration, and troubleshooting another step or two deeper. Now that you know the basics of how to build a small Ethernet LAN with Cisco switches, Part III begins by looking at typical Ethernet LAN designs. Understanding how a small LAN with one or two switches works is a great place to start, but understanding why an experi- enced network engineer might build a larger LAN a particular way helps you understand how LANs work in real networks. VLANs are one of the most powerful design tools for a network designer. VLANs also have a huge impact on how a switch works, which then impacts how you verify and troubleshoot the operation of a campus LAN. The second chapter in this part of the book shows the details of VLAN operation, along with VLAN trunking. The final chapter in this part of the book ends the chapters that focus on Ethernet. The Ethernet troubleshooting chapter, of course, discusses many details of how to troubleshoot an Ethernet LAN after you have implemented it. From a learning perspective, it also serves as a great review of many of the topics in Parts II and III of the book. Part III Ethernet LANs: Design, VLANs, and Troubleshooting Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs Part III Review CHAPTER 10 Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs This chapter covers the following exam topics: 1.0 Network Fundamentals 1.3 Describe the impact of infrastructure components in an enterprise network 1.3.b Access points 1.3.c Wireless controllers 1.4 Compare and contrast collapsed core and three-tier architectures 1.5 Compare and contrast network topologies 1.5.a Star 1.5.b Mesh 1.5.c Hybrid 1.6 Select the appropriate cabling type based on implementation requirements 2.0 LAN Switching Technologies 2.3 Troubleshoot interface and cable issues (collisions, errors, duplex, speed) Ethernet defines what happens on each Ethernet link, but the more interesting and more detailed work happens on the devices connected to those links: the network interface cards (NIC) inside devices and the LAN switches. This chapter takes the Ethernet LAN basics introduced in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” and dives deeply into many aspects of a modern Ethernet LAN, while focusing on the primary device used to create these LANs: LAN switches. This chapter breaks down the discussion of Ethernet and LAN switching into two sections. The first major section looks at the logic used by LAN switches when forwarding Ethernet frames, along with the related terminology. The second section considers design and imple- mentation issues, as if you were building a new Ethernet LAN in a building or campus. This second section considers design issues, including using switches for different purposes, when to choose different types of Ethernet links, and how to take advantage of Ethernet autonegotiation. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

(Choose two answers.) a. 100BASE-T b. 1000BASE-SX c. 1000BASE-T d. 1000BASE-LX Foundation Topics Analyzing Collision Domains and Broadcast Domains Ethernet devices, and the logic they use, have a big impact on why engineers design modern LANs in a certain way. Some of the terms used to describe key design features come from far back in the history of Ethernet, and because of their age, the meaning of each term may or may not be so obvious to someone learning Ethernet today. This first section of the chapter looks at two of these older terms in particular: collision domain and broadcast domain. And to understand these terms and apply them to modern Ethernet LANs, this sec- tion needs to work back through the history of Ethernet a bit, to put some perspective on the meaning behind these terms. Ethernet Collision Domains The term collision domain comes from the far back history of Ethernet LANs. To be hon- est, sometimes people new to Ethernet can get a little confused about what this term really means in the context of a modern Ethernet LAN, in part because modern Ethernet LANs, done properly, can completely prevent collisions. So to fully understand collision domains, we must first start with a bit of Ethernet history. This next section of the chapter looks at a few of the historical Ethernet devices, for the purpose of defining a collision domain, and then closing with some comments about how the term applies in a modern Ethernet LAN that uses switches. 10BASE-T with Hub 10BASE-T, introduced in 1990, significantly changed the design of Ethernet LANs, more like the designs seen today. 10BASE-T introduced the cabling model similar to today’s Ethernet LANs, with each device connecting to a centralized device using an unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable. However, 10BASE-T did not originally use LAN switches; instead, the early 10BASE-T networks used a device called an Ethernet hub. (The technology required to build even a basic LAN switch was not yet available at that time.) Although both a hub and a switch use the same cabling star topology, an Ethernet hub does not forward traffic like a switch. Ethernet hubs use physical layer processing to forward data. A hub does not interpret the incoming electrical signal as an Ethernet frame, look at the source and destination MAC address, and so on. Basically, a hub acts like a repeater, just with lots of ports. When a repeater receives an incoming electrical signal, it immediately forwards a regenerated signal out all the other ports except the incoming port. Physically, the hub just sends out a cleaner version of the same incoming electrical signal, as shown in Figure 10-1, with Larry’s signal being repeated out the two ports on the right. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 221 10 Larry Archie Bob Hub 1 2 2 Figure 10-1 10BASE-T (with a Hub): The Hub Repeats Out All Other Ports Because of the physical layer operation used by the hub, the devices attached to the net- work must use carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) to take turns (as introduced at the end of Chapter 2). Note that the hub itself does not use CSMA/ CD logic; the hub always receives an electrical signal and starts repeating a (regenerated) sig- nal out all other ports, with no thought of CSMA/CD. So, although a hub’s logic works well to make sure all devices get a copy of the original frame, that same logic causes frames to collide. Figure 10-2 demonstrates that effect, when the two devices on the right side of the figure send a frame at the same time, and the hub physically transmits both electrical signals out the port to the left (toward Larry). Larry Archie Bob Hub 1 Collision! 1B 1A2 Figure 10-2 Hub Operation Causing a Collision Because a hub makes no attempt to prevent collisions, the devices connected to it all sit within the same collision domain. A collision domain is the set of NICs and device ports for which if they sent a frame at the same time, the frames would collide. In Figures 10-1 and 10-2, all three PCs are in the same collision domain, as well as the hub. Summarizing the key points about hubs: ■ The hub acts a multiport repeater, blindly regenerating and repeating any incoming elec- trical signal out all other ports, even ignoring CSMA/CD rules. ■ When two or more devices send at the same time, the hub’s actions cause an electrical collision, making both signals corrupt. ■ The connected devices must take turns by using carrier sense multiple access with colli- sion detection (CSMA/CD) logic, so the devices share the bandwidth. ■ Hubs create a physical star topology. Ethernet Transparent Bridges From a design perspective, the introduction of 10BASE-T was a great improvement over the earlier types of Ethernet. It reduced cabling costs and cable installation costs, and improved the availability percentages of the network. But sitting here today, thinking of a LAN in which all devices basically have to wait their turn may seem like a performance issue, and it was. If Ethernet could be improved to allow multiple devices to send at the same time with- out causing a collision, Ethernet performance could be improved. Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 A 2 A, B, C 3 B, D 4 A, C 5 D 6 B, D 222 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The first method to allow multiple devices to send at the same time was Ethernet transpar- ent bridges. Ethernet transparent bridges, or simply bridges, made these improvements: ■ Bridges sat between hubs and divided the network into multiple collision domains. ■ Bridges increase the capacity of the entire Ethernet, because each collision domain is basically a separate instance of CSMA/CD, so each collision domain can have one sender at a time. Figure 10-3 shows the effect of building a LAN with two hubs, each separated by a bridge. The resulting two collision domains each support at most 10 Mbps of traffic each, com- pared to at most 10 Mbps if a single hub were used. 1 Collision Domain, Sharing 10 Mbps Bridge Fred Barney Wilma Betty Hub Hub 1 Collision Domain, Sharing 10 Mbps Figure 10-3 Bridge Creates Two Collision Domains and Two Shared Ethernets Bridges create multiple collision domains as a side effect of their forwarding logic. A bridge makes forwarding decisions just like a modern LAN switch; in fact, bridges were the prede- cessors of the modern LAN switch. Like switches, bridges hold Ethernet frames in memory, waiting to send out the outgoing interface based on CSMA/CD rules. In other cases, the bridge does not even need to forward the frame. For instance, if Fred sends a frame destined to Barney’s MAC address, then the bridge would never forward frames from the left to the right. Ethernet Switches and Collision Domains LAN switches perform the same basic core functions as bridges but at much faster speeds and with many enhanced features. Like bridges, switches segment a LAN into separate col- lision domains, each with its own capacity. And if the network does not have a hub, each single link in a modern LAN is considered its own collision domain, even if no collisions can actually occur in that case. For example, Figure 10-4 shows a simple LAN with a switch and four PCs. The switch creates four collision domains, with the ability to send at 100 Mbps in this case on each of the four links. And with no hubs, each link can run at full duplex, doubling the capac- ity of each link. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 223 10 F0/4 F0/3 Fred Barney F0/2 F0/1 Wilma Betty Full Duplex Full Duplex Full Duplex Full Duplex 100 Mbps 100 Mbps 100 Mbps 100 Mbps Four Possible Collision Domains Figure 10-4 Switch Creates Four Collision Domains and Four Ethernet Segments Now take a step back for a moment and think about some facts about modern Ethernet LANs. Today, you build Ethernet LANs with Ethernet switches, not with Ethernet hubs or bridges. The switches connect to each other. And every single link is a separate colli- sion domain. As strange as it sounds, each of those collision domains in a modern LAN may also never have a collision. Any link that uses full duplex—that is, both devices on the link use full duplex—does not have collisions. In fact, running with full duplex is basically this idea: No collisions can occur between a switch and a single device, so we can turn off CSMA/CD by running full duplex . NOTE The routers in a network design also create separate collision domains, because frames entering or exiting one router LAN interface do not collide with frames on another of the router’s LAN interfaces. The Impact of Collisions on LAN Design So, what is the useful takeaway from this discussion about collision domains? A long time ago, collisions were normal in Ethernet, so analyzing an Ethernet design to determine where the collision domains were was useful. On the other end of the spectrum, a modern campus LAN that uses only switches (and no hubs or transparent bridges), and full duplex on all links, has no collisions at all. So does the collision domain term still matter today? And do we need to think about collisions even still today? In a word, the term collision domain still matters, and collisions still matter, in that network engineers need to be ready to understand and troubleshoot exceptions. Whenever a port that could use full duplex (therefore avoiding collisions) happens to use half duplex—by incorrect configuration, by the result of autonegotiation, or any other reason—collisions can now occur. In those cases, engineers need to be able identify the collision domain. Summarizing the key points about collision domains: ■ LAN switches place each separate interface into a separate collision domain. ■ LAN bridges, which use the same logic as switches, placed each interface into a separate collision domain. ■ Routers place each LAN interface into a separate collision domain. (The term collision domain does not apply to WAN interfaces.) ■ LAN hubs do not place each interface into a separate collision domain. 224 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide ■ A modern LAN, with all LAN switches and routers, with full duplex on each link, would not have collisions at all. ■ In a modern LAN with all switches and routers, even though full duplex removes colli- sions, think of each Ethernet link as a separate collision domain when the need to trou- bleshoot arises. Figure 10-5 shows an example with a design that includes hubs, bridges, switches, and routers—a design that you would not use today, but it makes a good backdrop to remind us about which devices create separate collision domains. Hub 1 HubBridge Router Switch 2 3 4Five Collision Domains Figure 10-5 Example of a Hub Not Creating Multiple Collision Domains, While Others Do Ethernet Broadcast Domains Take any Ethernet LAN, and pick any device. Then think of that device sending an Ethernet broadcast. An Ethernet broadcast domain is the set of devices to which that broadcast is delivered. To begin, think about a modern LAN for a moment, and where a broadcast frame flows. Imagine that all the switches still used the switch default to put each interface into VLAN 1. As a result, a broadcast sent by any one device would be flooded to all devices connected to all switches (except for the device that sent the original frame). For instance, in Figure 10-6, under the assumption that all ports are still assigned to VLAN 1, a broadcast would flow to all the devices shown in the figure. 10/100/1000 10/100/1000 ..... 10/100/1000 10/100/1000 A40 D1 A2 A39 D1 A1 One VLAN! Figure 10-6 A Single Large Broadcast Domain Of all the common networking devices discussed in this book, only a router does not for- ward a LAN broadcast. Hubs of course forward broadcasts, because hubs do not even think about the electrical signal as an Ethernet frame. Bridges and switches use the same forward- ing logic, flooding LAN broadcasts. Routers, as a side effect of their routing logic, do not forward Ethernet broadcast frames, so they separate a network into separate broadcast domains. Figure 10-7 collects those thoughts into a single example. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 225 10 Hub 1 HubBridge Router Switch 2 3 4 Two Broadcast Domains Figure 10-7 Broadcast Domains Separated by a Router By definition, broadcasts sent by a device in one broadcast domain are not forwarded to devices in another broadcast domain. In this example, there are two broadcast domains. The router does not forward a LAN broadcast sent by a PC on the left to the network segment on the right. Virtual LANs Routers create multiple broadcast domains mostly as a side effect of how IP routing works. While a network designer might set about to use more router interfaces for the purpose of making a larger number of smaller broadcast domains, that plan quickly consumes router interfaces. But a better tool exists, one that is integrated into LAN switches and consumes no additional ports: virtual LANs (VLAN). By far, VLANs give the network designer the best tool for designing the right number of broadcast domains, of the right size, with the right devices in each. To appreciate how VLANs do that, you must first think about one specific definition of what a LAN is: A LAN consists of all devices in the same broadcast domain. With VLANs, a switch configuration places each port into a specific VLAN. The switches create multiple broadcast domains by putting some interfaces into one VLAN and other interfaces into other VLANs. The switch forwarding logic does not forward frames from a port in one VLAN out a port into another VLAN—so the switch separates the LAN into separate broadcast domains. Instead, routers must forward packets between the VLANs by using routing logic. So, instead of all ports on a switch forming a single broadcast domain, the switch separates them into many, based on configuration. For perspective, think about how you would create two different broadcast domains with switches if the switches had no concept of VLANs. Without any knowledge of VLANs, a switch would receive a frame on one port and flood it out all the rest of its ports. Therefore, to make two broadcast domains, two switches would be used—one for each broadcast domain, as shown in Figure 10-8. Dino Fred Wilma BettySW1 SW2 Left Broadcast Domain Right Broadcast Domain Figure 10-8 Sample Network with Two Broadcast Domains and No VLANs 226 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Alternatively, with a switch that understands VLANs, you can create multiple broad- cast domains using a single switch. All you do is put some ports in one VLAN and some in the other. (The Cisco Catalyst switch interface subcommand to do so is switchport access vlan 2, for instance, to place a port into VLAN 2.) Figure 10-9 shows the same two broadcast domains as in Figure 10-8, now implemented as two different VLANs on a single switch. Dino Fred Wilma BettySW1 VLAN 2VLAN 1 Left Broadcast Domain Right Broadcast Domain Figure 10-9 Sample Network with Two VLANs Using One Switch This section briefly introduces the concept of VLANs, but Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” discusses VLANs in more depth, including the details of how to configure VLANs in campus LANs. The Impact of Broadcast Domains on LAN Design Modern LAN designs try to avoid collisions, because collisions make performance worse. There is no benefit to keeping collisions in the network. However, a LAN design cannot remove broadcasts, because broadcast frames play an important role in many protocols. So when thinking about broadcast domains, the choices are more about tradeoffs rather than designing to remove broadcasts. For just one perspective, just think about the size of a broadcast domain—that is, the num- ber of devices in the same broadcast domain. A small number of large broadcast domains can lead to poor performance for the devices in that broadcast domain. However, moving in the opposite direction, to making a large number of broadcast domains each with just a few devices, leads to other problems. Consider the idea of a too-large broadcast domain for a moment. When a host receives a broadcast, the host must process the received frame. All hosts need to send some broad- casts to function properly, so when a broadcast arrives, the NIC must interrupt the com- puter’s CPU to give the incoming message to the CPU. The CPU must spend time think- ing about the received broadcast frame. (For example, IP Address Resolution Protocol [ARP] messages are LAN broadcasts, as mentioned in Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing.”) So, broadcasts happen, which is good, but broadcasts do require all the hosts to spend time processing each broadcast frame. The more devices in the same broadcast domain, the more unnecessary interruptions of each device’s CPU. This section of the book does not try to give a sweeping review of all VLAN design trad- eoffs. Instead, you can see that the size of a VLAN should be considered, but many other factors come in to play as well. How big are the VLANs? How are the devices grouped? Do VLANs span across all switches or just a few? Is there any apparent consistency to the VLAN design, or is it somewhat haphazard? Answering these questions helps reveal what the designer was thinking, as well as what the realities of operating a network may have required. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 227 10 NOTE If you would like more detail about Cisco recommendations about what to put in what VLAN, which impacts the size of VLANs, read the most recent Cisco document, “Campus LAN validated design” by searching on that phrase at Cisco.com. Summarizing the main points about broadcast domains: ■ Broadcasts exists, so be ready to analyze a design to define each broadcast domain, that is, each set of devices whose broadcasts reach the other devices in that domain. ■ VLANs by definition are broadcast domains created though configuration. ■ Routers, because they do not forward LAN broadcasts, create separate broadcast domains off their separate Ethernet interfaces. Analyzing Campus LAN Topologies The term campus LAN refers to the LAN created to support the devices in a building or in multiple buildings in somewhat close proximity to one another. For example, a company might lease office space in several buildings in the same office park. The network engineers can then build a campus LAN that includes switches in each building, plus Ethernet links between the switches in the buildings, to create a larger campus LAN. When planning and designing a campus LAN, the engineers must consider the types of Ethernet available and the cabling lengths supported by each type. The engineers also need to choose the speeds required for each Ethernet segment. In addition, some thought needs to be given to the idea that some switches should be used to connect directly to end-user devices, whereas other switches might need to simply connect to a large number of these end-user switches. Finally, most projects require that the engineer consider the type of equipment that is already installed and whether an increase in speed on some segments is worth the cost of buying new equipment. This second of three major sections of the chapter discusses the topology of a campus LAN design. Network designers do not just plug in devices to any port and connect switches to each other in an arbitrary way, like you might do with a few devices on the same table in a lab. Instead, there are known better ways to design the topology of a campus LAN, and this section introduces some of the key points and terms. The last major section of the chapter then looks at how to choose which Ethernet standard to use for each link in that campus LAN design, and why you might choose one versus another. Two-Tier Campus Design (Collapsed Core) To sift through all the requirements for a campus LAN, and then have a reasonable conver- sation about it with peers, most Cisco-oriented LAN designs use some common terminol- ogy to refer to the design. For this book’s purposes, you should be aware of some of the key campus LAN design terminology. The Two-Tier Campus Design Figure 10-10 shows a typical design of a large campus LAN, with the terminology included in the figure. This LAN has around 1000 PCs connected to switches that support around 25 ports each. Explanations of the terminology follow the figure. 228 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide 10/100/1000 10/100/1000 ..... 10/100/1000 10/100/1000 2 Distribution Switches 40 Access Switches Distribution Layer Access Layer ʜ������3&V 2 x 10 GbE GigEGigE Uplinks A40 D1 A2 A39 D1 A1 R1 R2 To WAN Figure 10-10 Campus LAN with Design Terminology Listed Cisco uses three terms to describe the role of each switch in a campus design: access, dis- tribution, and core. The roles differ based on whether the switch forwards traffic from user devices and the rest of the LAN (access), or whether the switch forwards traffic between other LAN switches (distribution and core). Access switches connect directly to end users, providing user device access to the LAN. Access switches normally send traffic to and from the end-user devices to which they are connected and sit at the edge of the LAN. Distribution switches provide a path through which the access switches can forward traffic to each other. By design, each of the access switches connects to at least one distribution switch, typically to two distribution switches for redundancy. The distribution switches provide the service of forwarding traffic to other parts of the LAN. Note that most designs use at least two uplinks to two different distribution switches (as shown in Figure 10-10) for redundancy. The figure shows a two-tier design, with the tiers being the access tier (or layer) and the dis- tribution tier (or layer). A two-tier design solves two major design needs: ■ Provides a place to connect end-user devices (the access layer, with access switches) ■ Connects the switches with a reasonable number of cables and switch ports by connect- ing all 40 access switches to two distribution switches Topology Terminology Seen Within a Two-Tier Design The exam topics happen to list a couple of terms about LAN and WAN topology and design, so this is a good place to pause to discuss those terms for a moment. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 229 10 First, consider these more formal definitions of four topology terms: Star: A design in which one central device connects to several others, so that if you drew the links out in all directions, the design would look like a star with light shining in all directions. Full mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between each pair of nodes. Partial mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between some pairs of nodes, but not all. In other words, a mesh that is not a full mesh. Hybrid: A design that combines topology design concepts into a larger (typically more complex) design. Armed with those formal definitions, note that the two-tier design is indeed a hybrid design that uses both a star topology at the access layer and a partial mesh at the distribution layer. To see why, consider Figure 10-11. It redraws a typical access layer switch, but instead of putting the PCs all below the switch, it spreads them around the switch. Then on the right, a similar version of the same drawing shows why the term star might be used—the topology looks a little like a child’s drawing of a star. Figure 10-11 The Star Topology Design Concept in Networking The distribution layer creates a partial mesh. If you view the access and distribution switch- es as nodes in a design, some nodes have a link between them, and some do not. Just refer to Figure 10-10 and note that, by design, none of the access layer switches connect to each other. Finally, a design could use a full mesh. However, for a variety of reasons beyond the scope of the design discussion here, a campus design typically does not need to use the number of links and ports required by a full mesh design. However, just to make the point, first con- sider how many links and switch ports would be required for a single link between nodes in a full mesh, with six nodes, as shown in Figure 10-12. 230 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide D1 D2 D6 D3 D5 D4 Figure 10-12 Using a Full Mesh at the Distribution Layer, 6 Switches, 15 Links Even with only six switches, a full mesh would consume 15 links (and 30 switch ports—two per link). Now think about a full mesh at the distribution layer for a design like Figure 10-10, with 40 access switches and two distribution switches. Rather than drawing it and counting it, the number of links is calculated with this old math formula from high school: N(N – 1) / 2, or in this case, 42 * 41 / 2 = 861 links, and 1722 switch ports consumed among all switches. For comparison’s sake, the partial mesh design of Figure 10-10, with a pair of links from each access switch to each distribution switch, requires only 160 links and a total of 320 ports among all switches. Three-Tier Campus Design (Core) The two-tier design of Figure 10-10, with a partial mesh of links at the distribution layer, happens to be the most common campus LAN design. It also goes by two common names: a two-tier design (for obvious reasons), and a collapsed core (for less obvious reasons). The term collapsed core refers to the fact that the two-tier design does not have a third tier, the core tier. This next topic examines a three-tier design that does have a core, for perspective. Imagine your campus has just two or three buildings. Each building has a two-tier design inside the building, with a pair of distribution switches in each building and access switches spread around the building as needed. How would you connect the LANs in each build- ing? Well, with just a few buildings, it makes sense to simply cable the distribution switches together, as shown in Figure 10-13. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 231 10 A11 A12 A13 A14 D11 D12 D21 D22 A21 A22 A23 A24 D31 D32 A31 A32 A33 A34 Building 1 Building 2 Building 3 Figure 10-13 Two-Tier Building Design, No Core, Three Buildings The design in Figure 10-13 works well, and many companies use this design. Sometimes the center of the network uses a full mesh, sometimes a partial mesh, depending on the avail- ability of cables between the buildings. However, a design with a third tier (a core tier) saves on switch ports and on cables in larger designs. And note that with the links between buildings, the cables run outside, are often more expensive to install, are almost always fiber cabling with more expensive switch ports, so conserving the number of cables used between buildings can help reduce costs. A three-tier core design, unsurprisingly at this point, adds a few more switches (core switch- es), which provide one function: to connect the distribution switches. Figure 10-14 shows the migration of the Figure 10-13 collapsed core (that is, a design without a core) to a three- tier core design. 232 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide A11 A12 A13 A14 A21 A22 A23 A24 A31 A32 A33 A34 Building 1 Building 2 Building 3 D11 D12 D21Core1 D22Core2 D31 D32 Figure 10-14 Three-Tier Building Design (Core Design), Three Buildings NOTE The core switches sit in the middle of the figure. In the physical world, they often sit in the same room as one of the distribution switches, rather than in some purpose-built room in the middle of the office park. The figure focuses more on the topology rather than the physical location. By using a core design, with a partial mesh of links in the core, you still provide connectivity to all parts of the LAN, and to the routers that send packets over the WAN, just with fewer links between buildings. The following list summarizes the terms that describe the roles of campus switches: ■ Access: Provides a connection point (access) for end-user devices. Does not forward frames between two other access switches under normal circumstances. ■ Distribution: Provides an aggregation point for access switches, providing connectivity to the rest of the devices in the LAN, forwarding frames between switches, but not con- necting directly to end-user devices. ■ Core: Aggregates distribution switches in very large campus LANs, providing very high forwarding rates for the larger volume of traffic due to the size of the network. Topology Design Terminology The ICND1 and CCNA exam topics specifically mention several network design terms related to topology. This next topic summarizes those key terms to connect the terms to the matching ideas. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 233 10 First, consider Figure 10-15, which shows a few of the terms. First, on the left, drawings often show access switches with a series of cables, parallel to each other. However, an access switch and its access links is often called a star topology. Why? Look at the redrawn access switch in the center of the figure, with the cables radiating out from the center. It does not look like a real star, but it looks a little like a child’s drawing of a star, hence the term star topology. Access Switch Access Switch: Star A1 A2 D1 D2 Uplinks: Partial Mesh SW1 SW1 Figure 10-15 LAN Design Terminology The right side of the figure repeats a typical two-tier design, focusing on the mesh of links between the access and distribution switches. Any group of nodes that connect with more links than a star topology is typically called a mesh. In this case, the mesh is a partial mesh, because not all nodes have a direct link between each other. A design that connects all nodes with a link would be a full mesh. Real networks make use of these topology ideas, but often a network combines the ideas together. For instance, the right side of Figure 10-14 combines the star topology of the access layer with the partial mesh of the distribution layer. So you might hear these designs that combine concepts called a hybrid design. Analyzing LAN Physical Standard Choices When you look at the design of a network designed by someone else, you can look at all the different types of cabling used, the different types of switch ports, and the Ethernet standards used in each case. Then ask yourself: Why did they choose a particular type of Ethernet link for each link in the network? Asking that question, and investigating the answer, starts to reveal much about building the physical campus LAN. The IEEE has done an amazing job developing Ethernet standards that give network design- ers many options. Two themes in particular have helped Ethernet grow over the long term: ■ The IEEE has developed many additional 802.3 standards for different types of cabling, different cable lengths, and for faster speeds. ■ All the physical standards rely on the same consistent data-link details, with the same standard frame formats. That means that one Ethernet LAN can use many types of physi- cal links to meet distance, budget, and cabling needs. For example, think about the access layer of the generic design drawings, but now think about cabling and Ethernet standards. In practice, access layer switches sit in a locked wiring closet somewhere on the same floor as the end user devices. Electricians have installed unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling used at the access layer, running from that wiring closet to each wall plate at each office, cubicle, or any place where an Ethernet device might need to connect to the LAN. The type and quality of the cabling installed 234 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide between the wiring closet and each Ethernet outlet dictate what Ethernet standards can be supported. Certainly, whoever designed the LAN at the time the cabling was installed thought about what type of cabling was needed to support the types of Ethernet physical standards that were going to be used in that LAN. Ethernet Standards Over time, the IEEE has continued to develop and release new Ethernet standards, for new faster speeds and to support new and different cabling types and cable lengths. Figure 10-16 shows some insight into Ethernet speed improvements over the years. The early standards up through the early 1990s ran at 10 Mbps, with steadily improving cabling and topologies. Then, with the introduction of Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) in 1995, the IEEE began ramping up the speeds steadily over the next few decades, continuing even until today. 2010 100 Gig E 100G 40 Gig E 40G 2005 10 Gig E 10G 2000 Gigabit Ethernet 1G 1995 Fast Ethernet 100M 1990 Ethernet 10Base-T 10M 1985 Thinnet (IEEE) 10M 1980 Thicknet (DIX) 10M Figure 10-16 Ethernet Standards Timeline NOTE Often, the IEEE first introduces support for the next higher speed using some forms of fiber optic cabling, and later, sometimes many years later, the IEEE completes the work to develop standards to support the same speed on UTP cabling. Figure 10-16 shows the earliest standards for each speed, no matter what cabling. When the IEEE introduces support for a new type of cabling, or a faster speed, they create a new standard as part of 802.3. These new standards have a few letters behind the name. So, when speaking of the standards, sometimes you might refer to the standard name (with letters). For instance, the IEEE standardized Gigabit Ethernet support using inexpensive UTP cabling in standard 802.3ab. However, more often, engineers refer to that same stan- dard as 1000BASE-T or simply Gigabit Ethernet. Table 10-2 lists some of the IEEE 802.3 physical layer standards and related names for perspective. Table 10-2 IEEE Physical Layer Standards Original IEEE Standard Shorthand Name Informal Names Speed Typical Cabling 802.3i 10BASE-T Ethernet 10 Mbps UTP 802.3u 100BASE-T Fast Ethernet 100 Mbps UTP 802.3z 1000BASE-X Gigabit Ethernet, GigE 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) Fiber 802.3ab 1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet, GigE 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) UTP 802.3ae 10GBASE-X 10 GigE 10 Gbps Fiber 802.3an 10GBASE-T 10 GigE 10 Gbps UTP 802.3ba 40GBASE-X 40 GigE 40 Gbps Fiber 802.3ba 100GBASE-X 100 GigE 100 Gbps Fiber Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 235 10 Choosing the Right Ethernet Standard for Each Link When designing an Ethernet LAN, you can and should think about the topology, with an access layer, a distribution layer, and possibly a core layer. But thinking about the topology does not tell you which specific standards to follow for each link. Ultimately, you need to pick which Ethernet standard to use for each link, based on the following kinds of facts about each physical standard: ■ The speed ■ The maximum distance allowed between devices when using that standard/cabling ■ The cost of the cabling and switch hardware ■ The availability of that type of cabling already installed at your facilities Consider the three most common types of Ethernet today (10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, and 1000BASE-T). They all have the same 100-meter UTP cable length restriction. They all use UTP cabling. However, not all UTP cabling meets the same quality standard, and as it turns out, the faster the Ethernet standard, the higher the required cable quality category needed to support that standard. As a result, some buildings might have better cabling that supports speeds up through Gigabit Ethernet, whereas some buildings may support only Fast Ethernet. The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA; tiaonline.org) defines Ethernet cabling quality standards. Each Ethernet UTP standard lists a TIA cabling quality (called a category) as the minimum category that the standard supports. For example, 10BASE-T allows for Category 3 (CAT3) cabling or better. 100BASE-T requires higher-quality CAT5 cabling, and 1000BASE-T requires even higher-quality CAT5e cabling. (The TIA standards follow a gen- eral “higher number is better cabling” in their numbering.) For instance, if an older facility had only CAT5 cabling installed between the wiring closets and each cubicle, the engineers would have to consider upgrading the cabling to fully support Gigabit Ethernet. Table 10-3 lists the more common types of Ethernet and their cable types and length limitations. Table 10-3 Ethernet Types, Media, and Segment Lengths (Per IEEE) Ethernet Type Media Maximum Segment Length 10BASE-T TIA CAT3 or better, 2 pairs 100 m (328 feet) 100BASE-T TIA CAT5 UTP or better, 2 pairs 100 m (328 feet) 1000BASE-T TIA CAT5e UTP or better, 4 pairs 100 m (328 feet) 10GBASE-T TIA CAT6a UTP or better, 4 pairs 100 m (328 feet) 10GBASE-T1 TIA CAT6 UTP or better, 4 pairs 38–55 m (127–180 feet) 1000BASE-SX Multimode fiber 550 m (1800 feet) 1000BASE-LX Multimode fiber 550 m (1800 feet) 1000BASE-LX 9-micron single -mode fiber 5 km (3.1 miles) 1 The option for 10GBASE-T with slightly less quality CAT6 cabling, but at shorter distances, is an attempt to support 10Gig Ethernet for some installations with CAT6 installed cabling. Ethernet defines standards for using fiber optic cables as well. Fiber optic cables include ultrathin strands of glass through which light can pass. To send bits, the switches can alter- nate between sending brighter and dimmer light to encode 0s and 1s on the cable. 236 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Generally comparing optical cabling versus UTP cabling Ethernet standards, two obvious points stand out. Optical standards allow much longer cabling, while generally costing more for the cable and the switch hardware components. Optical cables experience much less inter- ference from outside sources compared to copper cables, which allows for longer distances. When considering optical Ethernet links, many standards exist, but with two general catego- ries. Comparing the two, the cheaper options generally support distances into the hundreds of meters, using less expensive light-emitting diodes (LED) to transmit data. Other optical standards support much longer distances into multiple kilometers, using more expensive cabling and using lasers to transmit the data. The trade-off is basic: For a given link, how long does the cable need to run, what standards support that distance, and which is the least expensive to meet that need? In reality, most engineers remember only the general facts from tables like Table 10-3: 100 meters for UTP, about 500 meters for multimode fiber, and about 5000 meters for some single mode fiber Ethernet standards. When it is time to get serious about designing the details of each link, the engineer must get into the details, calculating the length of each cable based on its path through the building, and so on. Wireless LANs Combined with Wired Ethernet Modern campus LANs include a large variety of wireless devices that connect to the access layer of the LAN. As it turns out, Cisco organizes wireless LANs into a separate certification track—CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE Wireless—so the CCNA R&S track has traditionally had only a little wireless LAN coverage. The current version of the exams are no different, with this one exam CCNA R&S topic mentioning wireless LANs: Describe the impact of infrastructure components in an enterprise network: Access points and wireless controllers Do not let that small mention of wireless technology make you think that wireless is less important than Ethernet. In fact, there may be more wireless devices than wired at the access layer of today’s enterprise networks. Both are important; Cisco just happens to keep the educational material for wireless in a separate certification track. This last topic in the chapter examines that one exam topic that mentions two wireless terms. Home Office Wireless LANs First, the IEEE defines both Ethernet LANs and Wireless LANs. In case it was not obvi- ous yet, all Ethernet standards use cables—that is, Ethernet defines wired LANs. The IEEE 802.11 working group defines Wireless LANs, also called Wi-Fi per a trademarked term from the Wi-Fi Alliance (wi-fi.org), a consortium that helps to encourage wireless LAN development in the marketplace. Most of you have used Wi-Fi, and may use it daily. Some of you may have set it up at home, with a basic setup as shown in Figure 10-17. In a home, you probably used a single consumer device called a wireless router. One side of the device connects to the Internet, while the other side connects to the devices in the home. In the home, the devices can connect either with Wi-Fi or with a wired Ethernet cable. Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 237 10 UTP CATV Cable SOHO R1 ISP/Internet Figure 10-17 A Typical Home Wired and Wireless LAN While the figure shows the hardware as a single router icon, internally, that one wireless router acts like three separate devices you would find in an enterprise campus: ■ An Ethernet switch, for the wired Ethernet connections ■ A wireless access point (AP), to communicate with the wireless devices and forward the frames to/from the wired network ■ A router, to route IP packets to/from the LAN and WAN (Internet) interfaces Figure 10-18 repeats the previous figure, breaking out the internal components as if they were separate physical devices, just to make the point that a single consumer wireless router acts like several different devices. CATV Cable Cable ModemUTP UTPUTP SOHO R1 ISP/Internet Figure 10-18 A Representation of the Functions Inside a Consumer Wireless Routing Product In a small office/home office (SOHO) wireless LAN, the wireless AP acts autonomously, doing all the work required to create and control the wireless LAN (WLAN). (In most enter- prise WLANs, the AP does not act autonomously.) In other words, the autonomous AP communicates with the various wireless devices using 802.11 protocols and radio waves. It uses Ethernet protocols on the wired side. It converts between the differences in header formats between 802.11 and 802.3 frames before forwarding to/from 802.3 Ethernet and 802.11 wireless frames. Beyond those basic forwarding actions, the autonomous AP must perform a variety of con- trol and management functions. The AP authenticates new devices, defines the name of the WLAN (called a service set ID, or SSID), and other details. 238 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Enterprise Wireless LANs and Wireless LAN Controllers If you connect to your WLAN at home from your tablet, phone, or laptop, and then walk down the street with that same device, you expect to lose your Wi-Fi connection at some point. You do not expect to somehow automatically connect to a neighbor’s Wi-Fi net- work, particularly if they did the right thing and set up security functions on their AP to prevent others from accessing their home Wi-Fi network. The neighborhood does not cre- ate one WLAN supported by the devices in all the houses and apartments; instead, it has lots of little autonomous WLANs. However, in an enterprise, the opposite needs to happen. We want people to be able to roam around the building and office campus and keep connected to the Wi-Fi network. This requires many APs, which work together rather than autonomously to create one wire- less LAN. First, think about the number of APs an enterprise might need. Each AP can cover only a certain amount of space, depending on a large number of conditions and the wireless stan- dard. (The size varies, but the distances sit in the 100 to 200 feet range.) At the same time, you might have the opposite problem; you may just need lots of APs in a small space, just to add capacity to the WLAN. Much of the time spent designing WLANs revolves around deciding how many APs to place in each space, and of what types, to handle the traffic. NOTE If you have not paid attention before, start looking around the ceilings of any new buildings you enter, even retail stores, and look for their wireless APs. Each AP must then connect to the wired LAN, because most of the destinations that wire- less users need to communicate with sit in the wired part of the network. In fact, the APs typically sit close to where users sit, for obvious reasons, so the APs connect to the same access switches as the end users, as shown in Figure 10-19. A1 A2 A3 A4 D1 D2 1 2 Figure 10-19 Campus LAN, Multiple Lightweight APs, with Roaming Chapter 10: Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs 239 10 Now imagine that is you at the bottom of the figure. Your smartphone has Wi-Fi enabled, so that when you walk into work, your phone automatically connects to the company WLAN. You roam around all day, going to meetings, lunch, and so on. All day long you stay connect- ed to the company WLAN, but your phone connects to and uses many different APs. Supporting roaming and other enterprise WLAN features by using autonomous APs can be difficult at best. You could imagine that if you had a dozen APs per floor, you might have hundreds of APs in a campus—all of which need to know about that one WLAN. The solution: remove all the control and management features from the APs, and put them in one centralized place, called a Wireless Controller, or Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). The APs no longer act autonomously, but instead act as lightweight APs (LWAPs), just for- warding data between the wireless LAN and the WLC. All the logic to deal with roaming, defining WLANs (SSIDs), authentication, and so on happens in the centralized WLC rather than on each AP. Summarizing: Wireless LAN controller: Controls and manages all AP functions (for example, roaming, defining WLANs, authentication) Lightweight AP (LWAP): Forwards data between the wired and wireless LAN, and specifically forwarding data through the WLC using a protocol like Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) With the WLC and LWAP design, the combined LWAPs and WLC can create one big wireless network, rather than creating a multitude of disjointed wireless networks. The key to making it all work is that all wireless traffic flows through the WLC, as shown in Figure 10-20. (The LWAPs commonly use a protocol called CAPWAP, by the way.) 1 2 A1 A2 A3 A4 D1 D2 WLC Figure 10-20 Campus LAN, Multiple Lightweight APs, with Roaming By forwarding all the traffic through the WLC, the WLC can make the right decisions across the enterprise. For example, you might create a marketing WLAN, an engineer- ing WLAN, and so on, and all the APs know about and support those multiple different WLANs. Users that connect to the engineering WLAN should use the same authentication rules regardless of which AP they use—and the WLC makes that possible. Or consider 240 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide roaming for a moment. If at one instant a packet arrives for your phone, and you are associ- ated with AP1, and when the next packet arrives over the wired network you are now con- nected to AP4, how could that packet be delivered through the network? Well, it always goes to the WLC, and because the WLC keeps in contact with the APs and knows that your phone just roamed to another AP, the WLC knows where to forward the packet.

That core logic revolves around MAC addresses, the inter- face in which the frame arrives, and the interfaces out which the switch forwards the frame. Several switch features have some impact on an individual switch’s decisions about where to forward frames, but of all the topics in this book, virtual LANs (VLAN) easily have the big- gest impact on those choices. This chapter examines the concepts and configuration of VLANs. The first major section of the chapter explains the core concepts. These concepts include how VLANs work on a sin- gle switch, how to use VLAN trunking to create VLANs that span across multiple switches, and how to forward traffic between VLANs using a router. The second major section shows how to configure VLANs and VLAN trunks: how to statically assign interfaces to a VLAN. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

For example, from one perspective, a LAN includes all the user devices, servers, switches, routers, cables, and wireless access points in one location. However, an alternative narrower definition of a LAN can help in understanding the concept of a virtual LAN: A LAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain. A broadcast domain includes the set of all LAN-connected devices, so that when any of the devices sends a broadcast frame, all the other devices get a copy of the frame. So, from one perspective, you can think of a LAN and a broadcast domain as being basically the same thing. Without VLANs, a switch considers all its interfaces to be in the same broadcast domain. That is, for one switch, when a broadcast frame entered one switch port, the switch for- warded that broadcast frame out all other ports. With that logic, to create two different LAN broadcast domains, you had to buy two different Ethernet LAN switches, as shown in Figure 11-1. Dino Fred Wilma BettySW1 SW2 Subnet 2Subnet 1 Broadcast Domain 2 Broadcast Domain 1 Figure 11-1 Creating Two Broadcast Domains with Two Physical Switches and No VLANs Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 245 11 With support for VLANs, a single switch can accomplish the same goals of the design in Figure 11-1—to create two broadcast domains—with a single switch. With VLANs, a switch can configure some interfaces into one broadcast domain and some into another, creating multiple broadcast domains. These individual broadcast domains created by the switch are called virtual LANs (VLAN). For example, in Figure 11-2, the single switch creates two VLANs, treating the ports in each VLAN as being completely separate. The switch would never forward a frame sent by Dino (in VLAN 1) over to either Wilma or Betty (in VLAN 2). Fred Dino Betty Wilma Broadcast Domain 2 (VLAN 2) Broadcast Domain 1 (VLAN 1) SW1 Subnet 2Subnet 1 Figure 11-2 Creating Two Broadcast Domains Using One Switch and VLANs Designing campus LANs to use more VLANs, each with a smaller number of devices, often helps improve the LAN in many ways. For example, a broadcast sent by one host in a VLAN will be received and processed by all the other hosts in the VLAN—but not by hosts in a different VLAN. Limiting the number of hosts that receive a single broadcast frame reduces the number of hosts that waste effort processing unneeded broadcasts. It also reduces security risks, because fewer hosts see frames sent by any one host. These are just a few reasons for separating hosts into different VLANs. The following list summarizes the most common reasons for choosing to create smaller broadcast domains (VLANs): ■ To reduce CPU overhead on each device by reducing the number of devices that receive each broadcast frame ■ To reduce security risks by reducing the number of hosts that receive copies of frames that the switches flood (broadcasts, multicasts, and unknown unicasts) ■ To improve security for hosts that send sensitive data by keeping those hosts on a sepa- rate VLAN ■ To create more flexible designs that group users by department, or by groups that work together, instead of by physical location ■ To solve problems more quickly, because the failure domain for many problems is the same set of devices as those in the same broadcast domain ■ To reduce the workload for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) by limiting a VLAN to a single access switch This chapter does not examine all the reasons for VLANs in more depth. However, know that most enterprise networks use VLANs quite a bit. The rest of this chapter looks closely Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 B 2 D 3 B 4 A, C 5 A, B 6 B, C 246 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide at the mechanics of how VLANs work across multiple Cisco switches, including the required configuration. To that end, the next section examines VLAN trunking, a feature required when installing a VLAN that exists on more than one LAN switch. Creating Multiswitch VLANs Using Trunking Configuring VLANs on a single switch requires only a little effort: You simply configure each port to tell it the VLAN number to which the port belongs. With multiple switches, you have to consider additional concepts about how to forward traffic between the switches. When using VLANs in networks that have multiple interconnected switches, the switches need to use VLAN trunking on the links between the switches. VLAN trunking causes the switches to use a process called VLAN tagging, by which the sending switch adds another header to the frame before sending it over the trunk. This extra trunking header includes a VLAN identifier (VLAN ID) field so that the sending switch can associate the frame with a particular VLAN ID, and the receiving switch can then know in what VLAN each frame belongs. Figure 11-3 shows an example that demonstrates VLANs that exist on multiple switches, but it does not use trunking. First, the design uses two VLANs: VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. Each switch has two ports assigned to each VLAN, so each VLAN exists in both switches. To forward traffic in VLAN 10 between the two switches, the design includes a link between switches, with that link fully inside VLAN 10. Likewise, to support VLAN 20 traf- fic between switches, the design uses a second link between switches, with that link inside VLAN 20. VLAN 20 VLAN 10 Link is in VLAN 10 Link is in VLAN 20 SW1 11 12 21 22 SW2 13 14 23 24 Figure 11-3 Multiswitch VLAN Without VLAN Trunking The design in Figure 11-3 functions perfectly. For example, PC11 (in VLAN 10) can send a frame to PC14. The frame flows into SW1, over the top link (the one that is in VLAN 10) and over to SW2. The design shown in Figure 11-3 works, but it simply does not scale very well. It requires one physical link between switches to support every VLAN. If a design needed 10 or 20 VLANs, you would need 10 or 20 links between switches, and you would use 10 or 20 switch ports (on each switch) for those links. VLAN Tagging Concepts VLAN trunking creates one link between switches that supports as many VLANs as you need. As a VLAN trunk, the switches treat the link as if it were a part of all the VLANs. At Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 247 11 the same time, the trunk keeps the VLAN traffic separate, so frames in VLAN 10 would not go to devices in VLAN 20, and vice versa, because each frame is identified by VLAN num- ber as it crosses the trunk. Figure 11-4 shows the idea, with a single physical link between the two switches. VLAN 20 VLAN 10 SW1 SW220 10 20 10 20 Figure 11-4 Multiswitch VLAN with Trunking The use of trunking allows switches to pass frames from multiple VLANs over a single phys- ical connection by adding a small header to the Ethernet frame. For example, Figure 11-5 shows PC11 sending a broadcast frame on interface Fa0/1 at Step 1. To flood the frame, switch SW1 needs to forward the broadcast frame to switch SW2. However, SW1 needs to let SW2 know that the frame is part of VLAN 10, so that after the frame is received, SW2 will flood the frame only into VLAN 10, and not into VLAN 20. So, as shown at Step 2, before sending the frame, SW1 adds a VLAN header to the original Ethernet frame, with the VLAN header listing a VLAN ID of 10 in this case. 20 10 20 10 20 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 13 0/1 0/2 G0/2G0/1 0/3 0/4 14 23 24 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 11 0/1 0/3 0/4 21 22 33 Ethernet 1Ethernet 2 VLAN 10 Ethernet SW1 SW2 Figure 11-5 VLAN Trunking Between Two Switches When SW2 receives the frame, it understands that the frame is in VLAN 10. SW2 then removes the VLAN header, forwarding the original frame out its interfaces in VLAN 10 (Step 3). 248 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide For another example, consider the case when PC21 (in VLAN 20) sends a broadcast. SW1 sends the broadcast out port Fa0/4 (because that port is in VLAN 20) and out Gi0/1 (because it is a trunk, meaning that it supports multiple different VLANs). SW1 adds a trunking header to the frame, listing a VLAN ID of 20. SW2 strips off the trunking header after determining that the frame is part of VLAN 20, so SW2 knows to forward the frame out only ports Fa0/3 and Fa0/4, because they are in VLAN 20, and not out ports Fa0/1 and Fa0/2, because they are in VLAN 10. The 802.1Q and ISL VLAN Trunking Protocols Cisco has supported two different trunking protocols over the years: Inter-Switch Link (ISL) and IEEE 802.1Q. Cisco created the ISL long before 802.1Q, in part because the IEEE had not yet defined a VLAN trunking standard. Years later, the IEEE completed work on the 802.1Q standard, which defines a different way to do trunking. Today, 802.1Q has become the more popular trunking protocol, with Cisco not even supporting ISL in some of its newer models of LAN switches, including the 2960 switches used in the examples in this book. While both ISL and 802.1Q tag each frame with the VLAN ID, the details differ. 802.1Q inserts an extra 4-byte 802.1Q VLAN header into the original frame’s Ethernet header, as shown at the top of Figure 11-6. As for the fields in the 802.1Q header, only the 12-bit VLAN ID field inside the 802.1Q header matters for topics discussed in this book. This 12-bit field supports a theoretical maximum of 212 (4096) VLANs, but in practice it sup- ports a maximum of 4094. (Both 802.1Q and ISL use 12 bits to tag the VLAN ID, with two reserved values [0 and 4095].) 802.1Q Dest. Address Source Address Type Data FCSTag Type Priority Flag VLAN ID (12 Bits) Figure 11-6 802.1Q Trunking Cisco switches break the range of VLAN IDs (1–4094) into two ranges: the normal range and the extended range. All switches can use normal-range VLANs with values from 1 to 1005. Only some switches can use extended-range VLANs with VLAN IDs from 1006 to 4094. The rules for which switches can use extended-range VLANs depend on the con- figuration of the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), which is discussed briefly in the section “VLAN Trunking Configuration,” later in this chapter. 802.1Q also defines one special VLAN ID on each trunk as the native VLAN (defaulting to use VLAN 1). By definition, 802.1Q simply does not add an 802.1Q header to frames in the native VLAN. When the switch on the other side of the trunk receives a frame that does not have an 802.1Q header, the receiving switch knows that the frame is part of the native VLAN. Note that because of this behavior, both switches must agree on which VLAN is the native VLAN. The 802.1Q native VLAN provides some interesting functions, mainly to support connec- tions to devices that do not understand trunking. For example, a Cisco switch could be Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 249 11 cabled to a switch that does not understand 802.1Q trunking. The Cisco switch could send frames in the native VLAN—meaning that the frame has no trunking header—so that the other switch would understand the frame. The native VLAN concept gives switches the capability of at least passing traffic in one VLAN (the native VLAN), which can allow some basic functions, like reachability to telnet into a switch. Forwarding Data Between VLANs If you create a campus LAN that contains many VLANs, you typically still need all devices to be able to send data to all other devices. This next topic discusses some concepts about how to route data between those VLANs. First, it helps to know a few terms about some categories of LAN switches. All the Ethernet switch functions described in this book so far use the details and logic defined by OSI Layer 2 protocols. For example, Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching,” discussed how LAN switches receive Ethernet frames (a Layer 2 concept), look at the destination Ethernet MAC address (a Layer 2 address), and forward the Ethernet frame out some other interface. This chapter has already discussed the concept of VLANs as broadcast domains, which is yet another Layer 2 concept. While some LAN switches work just as described so far in this book, some LAN switches have even more functions. LAN switches that forward data based on Layer 2 logic, as dis- cussed so far in this book, often go by the name Layer 2 switch. However, some other switches can do some functions like a router, using additional logic defined by Layer 3 pro- tocols. These switches go by the name multilayer switch, or Layer 3 switch. This section first discusses how to forward data between VLANs when using Layer 2 switches and ends with a brief discussion of how to use Layer 3 switches. Routing Packets Between VLANs with a Router When including VLANs in a campus LAN design, the devices in a VLAN need to be in the same subnet. Following the same design logic, devices in different VLANs need to be in dif- ferent subnets. For example, in Figure 11-7, the two PCs on the left sit in VLAN 10, in sub- net 10. The two PCs on the right sit in a different VLAN (20), with a different subnet (20). Wilma Betty Dino VLAN 20 Subnet 20 VLAN 10 Subnet 10 Fred Figure 11-7 Layer 2 Switch Does Not Route Between the VLANs NOTE The figure refers to subnets somewhat generally, like “subnet 10,” just so the sub- net numbers do not distract. Also, note that the subnet numbers do not have to be the same number as the VLAN numbers. Figure 11-7 shows the switch as if it were two switches broken in two to emphasize the point that Layer 2 switches will not forward data between two VLANs. When configured with some ports in VLAN 10 and others in VLAN 20, the switch acts like two separate switches in which it will forward traffic. In fact, one goal of VLANs is to separate traffic in one VLAN from another, preventing frames in one VLAN from leaking over to other 250 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide VLANs. For example, when Dino (in VLAN 10) sends any Ethernet frame, if SW1 is a Layer 2 switch, that switch will not forward the frame to the PCs on the right in VLAN 20. The network as a whole needs to support traffic flowing into and out of each VLAN, even though the Layer 2 switch does not forward frames outside a VLAN. The job of forwarding data into and out of a VLAN falls to routers. Instead of switching Layer 2 Ethernet frames between the two VLANs, the network must route Layer 3 packets between the two subnets. That previous paragraph has some very specific wording related to Layers 2 and 3, so take a moment to reread and reconsider it for a moment. The Layer 2 logic does not let the Layer 2 switch forward the Layer 2 protocol data unit (L2PDU), the Ethernet frame, between VLANs. However, routers can route Layer 3 PDUs (L3PDU) (packets) between subnets as their normal job in life. For example, Figure 11-8 shows a router that can route packets between subnets 10 and 20. The figure shows the same Layer 2 switch as shown in Figure 11-7, with the same perspec- tive of the switch being split into parts with two different VLANs, and with the same PCs in the same VLANs and subnets. Now Router R1 has one LAN physical interface connected to the switch and assigned to VLAN 10, and a second physical interface connected to the switch and assigned to VLAN 20. With an interface connected to each subnet, the Layer 2 switch can keep doing its job—forwarding frames inside a VLAN, while the router can do its job—routing IP packets between the subnets. Wilma Betty Dino F0/0 F0/1 VLAN 20 Subnet 20 VLAN 10 Subnet 10 Fred R1 Figure 11-8 Routing Between Two VLANs on Two Physical Interfaces The figure shows an IP packet being routed from Fred, which sits in one VLAN/subnet, to Betty, which sits in the other. The Layer 2 switch forwards two different Layer 2 Ethernet frames: one in VLAN 10, from Fred to R1’s F0/0 interface, and the other in VLAN 20, from R1’s F0/1 interface to Betty. From a Layer 3 perspective, Fred sends the IP packet to its default router (R1), and R1 routes the packet out another interface (F0/1) into another sub- net where Betty resides. While the design shown in Figure 11-8 works, it uses too many physical interfaces, one per VLAN. A much less expensive (and much preferred) option uses a VLAN trunk between the switch and router, requiring only one physical link between the router and switch, while supporting all VLANs. Trunking can work between any two devices that choose to support it: between two switches, between a router and a switch, or even between server hardware and a switch. Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 251 11 Figure 11-9 shows the same design idea as Figure 11-8, with the same packet being sent from Fred to Betty, except now R1 uses VLAN trunking instead of a separate link for each VLAN. Fred F0/0 Dino Betty Wilma VLAN 20 Subnet 20 VLAN 10 Subnet 10 SW1 R1 1 2 Figure 11-9 Routing Between Two VLANs Using a Trunk on the Router NOTE Because the router has a single physical link connected to the LAN switch, this design is sometimes called a router-on-a-stick. As a brief aside about terminology, many people describe the concept in Figures 11-8 and 11-9 as “routing packets between VLANs.” You can use that phrase, and people know what you mean. However, note that this phrase is not literally true, because it refers to routing packets (a Layer 3 concept) and VLANs (a Layer 2 concept). It just takes fewer words to say something like “routing between VLANs” rather than the literally true but long “routing Layer 3 packets between Layer 3 subnets, with those subnets each mapping to a Layer 2 VLAN.” Routing Packets with a Layer 3 Switch Routing packets using a physical router, even with the VLAN trunk in the router-on-a-stick model shown in Figure 11-9, still has one significant problem: performance. The physical link puts an upper limit on how many bits can be routed, and less expensive routers tend to be less powerful, and might not be able to route a large enough number of packets per sec- ond (pps) to keep up with the traffic volumes. The ultimate solution moves the routing functions inside the LAN switch hardware. Vendors long ago started combining the hardware and software features of their Layer 2 LAN switches, plus their Layer 3 routers, creating products called Layer 3 switches (also known as multilayer switches). Layer 3 switches can be configured to act only as a Layer 2 switch, or they can be configured to do both Layer 2 switching as well as Layer 3 routing. Today, many medium- to large-sized enterprise campus LANs use Layer 3 switches to route packets between subnets (VLANs) in a campus. In concept, a Layer 3 switch works a lot like the original two devices on which the Layer 3 switch is based: a Layer 2 LAN switch and a Layer 3 router. In fact, if you take the concepts and packet flow shown in Figure 11-8, with a separate Layer 2 switch and Layer 3 router, and then imagine all those features happening inside one device, you have the general idea of what a Layer 3 switch does. Figure 11-10 shows that exact concept, repeating many details of Figure 11-8, but with an overlay that shows the one Layer 3 switch doing the Layer 2 switch functions and the separate Layer 3 routing function. 252 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Fred Interface VLAN 10 Interface VLAN 20 Layer 3 Switch Dino Betty Wilma Layer 2 Switch Layer 3 Router (All Functions in Middle Box) VLAN 20 Subnet 20 VLAN 10 Subnet 10 Figure 11-10 Multilayer Switch: Layer 2 Switching with Layer 3 Routing in One Device This chapter introduces the core concepts of routing IP packets between VLANs (or more accurately, between the subnets on the VLANs). Chapter 18, “Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes,” shows how to configure designs that use an external router with router- on-a-stick. This chapter now turns its attention to configuration and verification tasks for VLANs and VLAN trunks. VLAN and VLAN Trunking Configuration and Verification Cisco switches do not require any configuration to work. You can purchase Cisco switches, install devices with the correct cabling, turn on the switches, and they work. You would never need to configure the switch, and it would work fine, even if you interconnected switches, until you needed more than one VLAN. But if you want to use VLANs—and most enterprise networks do—you need to add some configuration. This chapter separates the VLAN configuration details into two major sections. The first section looks at how to configure access interfaces, which are switch interfaces that do not use VLAN trunking. The second part shows how to configure interfaces that do use VLAN trunking. Creating VLANs and Assigning Access VLANs to an Interface This section shows how to create a VLAN, give the VLAN a name, and assign interfaces to a VLAN. To focus on these basic details, this section shows examples using a single switch, so VLAN trunking is not needed. For a Cisco switch to forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must be configured to believe that the VLAN exists. In addition, the switch must have nontrunking interfaces (called access interfaces) assigned to the VLAN, and/or trunks that support the VLAN. The configuration steps for access interfaces are as follows, with the trunk configuration shown later in the section “VLAN Trunking Configuration”: Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 253 11 Step 1. To configure a new VLAN, follow these steps: A. From configuration mode, use the vlan vlan-id command in global con- figuration mode to create the VLAN and to move the user into VLAN con- figuration mode. B. (Optional) Use the name name command in VLAN configuration mode to list a name for the VLAN. If not configured, the VLAN name is VLANZZZZ, where ZZZZ is the four-digit decimal VLAN ID. Step 2. For each access interface (each interface that does not trunk, but instead belongs to a single VLAN), follow these steps: A. Use the interface type number command in global configuration mode to move into interface configuration mode for each desired interface. B. Use the switchport access vlan id-number command in interface configu- ration mode to specify the VLAN number associated with that interface. C. (Optional) Use the switchport mode access command in interface configu- ration mode to make this port always operate in access mode (that is, to not trunk). While the list might look a little daunting, the process on a single switch is actually pretty simple. For example, if you want to put the switch’s ports in three VLANs—11, 12, and 13—you just add three vlan commands: vlan 11, vlan 12, and vlan 13. Then, for each inter- face, add a switchport access vlan 11 (or 12 or 13) command to assign that interface to the proper VLAN. NOTE The term default VLAN (as shown in the exam topics) refers to the default setting on the switchport access vlan vlan-id command, and that default is VLAN ID 1. In other words, by default, each port is assigned to access VLAN 1. VLAN Configuration Example 1: Full VLAN Configuration Example 11-1 shows the configuration process of adding a new VLAN and assigning access interfaces to that VLAN. Figure 11-11 shows the network used in the example, with one LAN switch (SW1) and two hosts in each of three VLANs (1, 2, and 3). The example shows the details of the two-step process for VLAN 2 and the interfaces in VLAN 2, with the con- figuration of VLAN 3 deferred until the next example.

(VLAN 1 cannot be deleted, but can be used. VLANs 1002–1005 cannot be deleted and cannot be used as access VLANs today.) In particular, note that this 2960 switch has 24 Fast Ethernet ports (Fa0/1–Fa0/24) and two Gigabit Ethernet ports (Gi0/1 and Gi0/2), all of which are listed as being in VLAN 1 per that first command’s output. Next, the example shows the process of creating VLAN 2 and assigning interfaces Fa0/13 and Fa0/14 to VLAN 2. Note in particular that the example uses the interface range com- mand, which causes the switchport access vlan 2 interface subcommand to be applied to both interfaces in the range, as confirmed in the show running-config command output at the end of the example. After the configuration has been added, to list the new VLAN, the example repeats the show vlan brief command. Note that this command lists VLAN 2, name Freds-vlan, and the interfaces assigned to that VLAN (Fa0/13 and Fa0/14). The show vlan id 2 command that follows then confirms that ports Fa0/13 and Fa0/14 are assigned to VLAN 2. 256 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The example surrounding Figure 11-11 uses six switch ports, all of which need to operate as access ports. That is, each port should not use trunking, but instead should be assigned to a single VLAN, as assigned by the switchport access vlan vlan-id command. However, as configured in Example 11-1, these interfaces could negotiate to later become trunk ports, because the switch defaults to allow the port to negotiate trunking and decide whether to act as an access interface or as a trunk interface. For ports that should always act as access ports, add the optional interface subcommand switchport mode access. This command tells the switch to only allow the interface to be an access interface. The upcoming section “VLAN Trunking Configuration” discusses more details about the commands that allow a port to negotiate whether it should use trunking. NOTE The book includes a video that works through a different VLAN configuration example as well. You can find the video on the DVD and on the companion website. VLAN Configuration Example 2: Shorter VLAN Configuration Example 11-1 shows several of the optional configuration commands, with a side effect of being a bit longer than is required. Example 11-2 shows a much briefer alternative configu- ration, picking up the story where Example 11-1 ended and showing the addition of VLAN 3 (as shown in Figure 11-11). Note that SW1 does not know about VLAN 3 at the beginning of this example. Example 11-2 Shorter VLAN Configuration Example (VLAN 3) SW1# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line.

This example begins with SW1 not knowing about VLAN 3. When the switchport access vlan 3 interface subcommand was used, the switch realized that VLAN 3 did not exist, and as noted in the shaded message in the example, the switch created VLAN 3, using a default name (VLAN0003). No other steps are required to create the VLAN. At the end of the process, VLAN 3 exists in the switch, and interfaces Fa0/15 and Fa0/16 are in VLAN 3, as noted in the shaded part of the show vlan brief command output. VLAN Trunking Protocol Before showing more configuration examples, you also need to know something about a Cisco protocol and tool called the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP). VTP is a Cisco propri- etary tool on Cisco switches that advertises each VLAN configured in one switch (with the vlan number command) so that all the other switches in the campus learn about that VLAN. However, for various reasons, many enterprises choose not to use VTP. This book does not discuss VTP as an end to itself. However, VTP has some small impact on how every Cisco Catalyst switch works, even if you do not try to use VTP. This brief section introduces enough details of VTP so that you can see these small differences in VTP that cannot be avoided. This book attempts to ignore VTP as much as is possible. To that end, all examples in this book use switches that have either been set to use VTP transparent mode (with the vtp mode transparent global command) or to disable it (with the vtp mode off global com- mand). Both options allow the administrator to configure both standard- and extended- range VLANs, and the switch lists the vlan commands in the running-config file. Finally, on a practical note, if you happen to do lab exercises with real switches or with simulators, and you see unusual results with VLANs, check the VTP status with the show vtp status command. If your switch uses VTP server or client mode, you will find: ■ The server switches can configure VLANs in the standard range only (1–1005). ■ The client switches cannot configure VLANs. ■ Both servers and clients may be learning new VLANs from other switches, and seeing their VLANs deleted by other switches, because of VTP. ■ The show running-config command does not list any vlan commands. If possible in lab, switch to VTP transparent mode and ignore VTP for your switch con- figuration practice until you are ready to focus on how VTP works when studying for the ICND2 exam topics. NOTE Do not change VTP settings on any switch that also connects to the production network until you know how VTP works and you talk with experienced colleagues. If the switch you configure connects to other switches, which in turn connect to switches used in the production LAN, you could accidentally change the VLAN configuration in other switches with serious impact to the operation of the network. Be careful and never experi- ment with VTP settings on a switch unless it, and the other switches connected to it, have absolutely no physical links connected to the production LAN. 258 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide VLAN Trunking Configuration Trunking configuration between two Cisco switches can be very simple if you just statically configure trunking. For example, if two Cisco 2960 switches connect to each other, they support only 802.1Q and not ISL. You could literally add one interface subcommand for the switch interface on each side of the link ( switchport mode trunk), and you would create a VLAN trunk that supported all the VLANs known to each switch. However, trunking configuration on Cisco switches includes many more options, including several options for dynamically negotiating various trunking settings. The configuration can either predefine different settings or tell the switch to negotiate the settings, as follows: ■ The type of trunking: IEEE 802.1Q, ISL, or negotiate which one to use ■ The administrative mode: Whether to always trunk, always not trunk, or negotiate First, consider the type of trunking. Cisco switches that support ISL and 802.1Q can negoti- ate which type to use, using the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP). If both switches support both protocols, they use ISL; otherwise, they use the protocol that both support. Today, many Cisco switches do not support the older ISL trunking protocol. Switches that support both types of trunking use the switchport trunk encapsulation {dot1q | isl | negotiate} inter- face subcommand to either configure the type or allow DTP to negotiate the type. DTP can also negotiate whether the two devices on the link agree to trunk at all, as guided by the local switch port’s administrative mode. The administrative mode refers to the configuration setting for whether trunking should be used. Each interface also has an operational mode, which refers to what is currently happening on the interface, and might have been chosen by DTP’s negotiation with the other device. Cisco switches use the switchport mode interface subcommand to define the administrative trunking mode, as listed in Table 11-2. Table 11-2 Trunking Administrative Mode Options with the switchport mode Command Command Option Description access Always act as an access (nontrunk) port trunk Always act as a trunk port dynamic desirable Initiates negotiation messages and responds to negotiation messages to dynamically choose whether to start using trunking dynamic auto Passively waits to receive trunk negotiation messages, at which point the switch will respond and negotiate whether to use trunking For example, consider the two switches shown in Figure 11-12. This figure shows an expansion of the network of Figure 11-11, with a trunk to a new switch (SW2) and with parts of VLANs 1 and 3 on ports attached to SW2. The two switches use a Gigabit Ethernet link for the trunk. In this case, the trunk does not dynamically form by default, because both (2960) switches default to an administrative mode of dynamic auto, meaning that neither switch initiates the trunk negotiation process. By changing one switch to use dynamic desirable mode, which does initiate the negotiation, the switches negotiate to use trunking, specifically 802.1Q because the 2960s support only 802.1Q.

Note that the next command results in a single empty line of output. SW1# show interfaces trunk SW1# First, focus on the highlighted items from the output of the show interfaces switchport command at the beginning of Example 11-3. The output lists the default administrative mode setting of dynamic auto. Because SW2 also defaults to dynamic auto, the command lists SW1’s operational status as “access,” meaning that it is not trunking. (“Dynamic auto” tells both switches to sit there and wait on the other switch to start the negotiations.) The third shaded line points out the only supported type of trunking (802.1Q) on this 2960 switch. (On a switch that supports both ISL and 802.1Q, this value would by default list “negotiate,” to mean that the type of encapsulation is negotiated.) Finally, the operational trunking type is listed as “native,” which is a reference to the 802.1Q native VLAN. The end of the example shows the output of the show interfaces trunk command, but with no output. This command lists information about all interfaces that currently operationally trunk; that is, it lists interfaces that currently use VLAN trunking. With no interfaces listed, this command also confirms that the link between switches is not trunking. Next, consider Example 11-4, which shows the new configuration that enables trunking. In this case, SW1 is configured with the switchport mode dynamic desirable command, which asks the switch to both negotiate as well as to begin the negotiation process, rather than waiting on the other device. As soon as the command is issued, log messages appear show- ing that the interface goes down and then back up again, which happens when the interface transitions from access mode to trunk mode. Example 11-4 SW1 Changes from Dynamic Auto to Dynamic Desirable SW1# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.

Note that the command still lists the administrative 262 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide settings, which denote the configured values along with the operational settings, which list what the switch is currently doing. In this case, SW1 now claims to be in an opera- tional mode of trunk, with an operational trunking encapsulation of dot1Q. The end of the example shows the output of the show interfaces trunk command, which now lists G0/1, confirming that G0/1 is now operationally trunking. The next section dis- cusses the meaning of the output of this command. For the exams, you should be ready to interpret the output of the show interfaces switchport command, realize the administrative mode implied by the output, and know whether the link should operationally trunk based on those settings. Table 11-3 lists the combinations of the trunking administrative modes and the expected operational mode (trunk or access) resulting from the configured settings. The table lists the administrative mode used on one end of the link on the left, and the administrative mode on the switch on the other end of the link across the top of the table. Table 11-3 Expected Trunking Operational Mode Based on the Configured Administrative Modes Administrative Mode Access Dynamic Auto Trunk Dynamic Desirable access Access Access Do Not Use1 Access dynamic auto Access Access Trunk Trunk trunk Do Not Use1 Trunk Trunk Trunk dynamic desirable Access Trunk Trunk Trunk 1 When two switches configure a mode of “access” on one end and “trunk” on the other, problems occur. Avoid this combination. Finally, before leaving the discussion of configuring trunks, Cisco recommends disabling trunk negotiation on most ports for better security. The majority of switch ports on most switches will be used to connect to users. As a matter of habit, you can disable DTP nego- tiations altogether using the switchport nonegotiate interface subcommand. Implementing Interfaces Connected to Phones This next topic is a strange topic, at least in the context of access links and trunk links. In the world of IP telephony, telephones use Ethernet ports to connect to an Ethernet network so they can use IP to send and receive voice traffic sent via IP packets. To make that work, the switch’s Ethernet port acts like an access port—but at the same time, the port acts like a trunk in some ways. This last topic of the chapter works through those main concepts. Data and Voice VLAN Concepts Before IP telephony, a PC could sit on the same desk as a phone. The phone happened to use UTP cabling, with that phone connected to some voice device (often called a voice switch or a private branch exchange [PBX]). The PC, of course, connected using a unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable to the usual LAN switch that sat in the wiring closet— sometimes in the same wiring closet as the voice switch. Figure 11-13 shows the idea. Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 263 11 Telephone UTP Ethernet UTP Voice Switch Closet Ethernet Switch 8VHU·V�\\'HVN Figure 11-13 Before IP Telephony: PC and Phone, One Cable Each, Connect to Two Different Devices The term IP telephony refers to the branch of networking in which the telephones use IP packets to send and receive voice as represented by the bits in the data portion of the IP packet. The phones connect to the network like most other end-user devices, using either Ethernet or Wi-Fi. These new IP phones did not connect via cable directly to a voice switch, instead connecting to the IP network using an Ethernet cable and an Ethernet port built in to the phone. The phones then communicated over the IP network with software that replaced the call setup and other functions of the PBX. (The current products from Cisco that perform this IP telephony control function are called Cisco Unified Communication Manager.) The migration from using the already-installed telephone cabling, to these new IP phones that needed UTP cables that supported Ethernet, caused some problems in some offices. In particular: ■ The older non-IP phones used a category of UTP cabling that often did not support 100-Mbps or 1000-Mbps Ethernet. ■ Most offices had a single UTP cable running from the wiring closet to each desk, but now two devices (the PC and the new IP phone) both needed a cable from the desktop to the wiring closet. ■ Installing a new cable to every desk would be expensive, plus you would need more switch ports. To solve this problem, Cisco embedded small three-port switches into each phone. IP telephones have included a small LAN switch, on the underside of the phone, since the earliest IP telephone products. Figure 11-14 shows the basic cabling, with the wiring closet cable connecting to one physical port on the embedded switch, the PC connecting with a short patch cable to the other physical port, and the phone’s internal CPU connecting to an internal switch port. Ethernet UTP Wiring Closet Ethernet Switch PC Phone Patch Cable 8VHU·V�\\'HVN IP Embedded Switch Figure 11-14 Cabling with an IP Phone, a Single Cable, and an Integrated Switch 264 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Sites that use IP telephony, which includes most every company today, now have two devic- es off each access port. In addition, Cisco best practices for IP telephony design tell us to put the phones in one VLAN, and the PCs in a different VLAN. To make that happen, the switch port acts a little like an access link (for the PC’s traffic), and a little like a trunk (for the phone’s traffic). The configuration defines two VLANs on that port, as follows: Data VLAN: Same idea and configuration as the access VLAN on an access port, but defined as the VLAN on that link for forwarding the traffic for the device connected to the phone on the desk (typically the user’s PC). Voice VLAN: The VLAN defined on the link for forwarding the phone’s traffic. Traffic in this VLAN is typically tagged with an 802.1Q header. Figure 11-15 illustrates this design with two VLANs on access ports that support IP telephones. VLAN 11 VLAN 10 IP IP IP IP Voice VLAN Data VLAN Figure 11-15 A LAN Design, with Data in VLAN 10 and Phones in VLAN 11 Data and Voice VLAN Configuration and Verification Configuring a switch port to support IP phones, once you know the planned voice and data VLAN IDs, is easy. Making sense of the show commands once it is configured can be a challenge. The port acts like an access port in many ways. However, with most configuration options, the voice frames flow with an 802.1Q header, so that the link supports frames in both VLANs on the link. But that makes for some different show command output. Example 11-5 shows an example. In this case, all four switch ports F0/1–F0/4 begin with default configuration. The configuration adds the new data and voice VLANs. The example then configures all four ports as access ports, and defines the access VLAN, which is also called the data VLAN when discussing IP telephony. Finally, the configuration includes the switchport voice vlan 11 command, which defines the voice VLAN used on the port. The example matches Figure 11-15, using ports F0/1–F0/4. Example 11-5 Configuring the Voice and Data VLAN on Ports Connected to Phones SW1# configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. SW1(config)# vlan 10 SW1(config-vlan)# vlan 11 Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 265 11 SW1(config-vlan)# interface range FastEthernet0/1 - 4 SW1(config-if)# switchport mode access SW1(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10 SW1(config-if)# switchport voice vlan 11 SW1(config-if)#^Z SW1# NOTE CDP, which is discussed in Chapter 33, “Device Management Protocols,” must be enabled on an interface for a voice access port to work with Cisco IP Phones. CDP is enabled by default, so its configuration is not shown here. The following list details the configuration steps for easier review and study: Step 1. Use the vlan vlan-id command in global configuration mode to create the data and voice VLANs if they do not already exist on the switch. Step 2. Configure the data VLAN like an access VLAN, as usual: A. Use the interface type number command global configuration mode to move into interface configuration mode. B. Use the switchport access vlan id-number command in interface configu- ration mode to define the data VLAN. C. Use the switchport mode access command in interface configuration mode to make this port always operate in access mode (that is, to not trunk). Step 3. Use the switchport voice vlan id-number command in interface configuration mode to set the voice VLAN ID. Verifying the status of a switch port configured like Example 11-5 shows some different output compared to the pure access port and pure trunk port configurations seen earlier in this chapter. For example, the show interfaces switchport command shows details about the operation of an interface, including many details about access ports. Example 11-6 shows those details for port F0/4 after the configuration in Example 11-5 was added. Example 11-6 Verifying the Data VLAN (Access VLAN) and Voice VLAN SW1# show interfaces FastEthernet 0/4 switchport Name: Fa0/4 Switchport: Enabled Administrative Mode: static access Operational Mode: static access Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native Negotiation of Trunking: Off Access Mode VLAN: 10 (VLAN0010) Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default) Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled Voice VLAN: 11 (VLAN0011) ! The rest of the output is omitted for brevity Config Checklist 266 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Working through the first three highlighted lines in the output, all those details should look familiar for any access port. The switchport mode access configuration command statically configures the administrative mode to be an access port, so the port of course operates as an access port. Also, as shown in the third highlighted line, the switchport access vlan 10 configuration command defined the access mode VLAN as highlighted here. The fourth highlighted line shows the one small new piece of information: the voice VLAN ID, as set with the switchport voice vlan 11 command in this case. This small line of out- put is the only piece of information in the output that differs from the earlier access port examples in this chapter. These ports act more like access ports than trunk ports. In fact, the show interfaces type number switchport command boldly proclaims, “Operational Mode: static access.” However, one other show command reveals just a little more about the underlying opera- tion with 802.1Q tagging for the voice frames. As mentioned earlier, the show interfaces trunk command—that is, the command that does not include a specific interface in the middle of the command—lists the operational trunks on a switch. With IP telephony ports, the ports do not show up in the list of trunks either— providing evidence that these links are not treated as trunks. Example 11-7 shows just such an example. However, the show interfaces trunk command with the interface listed in the middle of the command, as is also shown in Example 11-7, does list some additional information. Note that in this case, the show interfaces F0/4 trunk command lists the status as not-trunking, but with VLANs 10 and 11 allowed on the trunk. (Normally, on an access port, only the access VLAN is listed in the “VLANs allowed on the trunk” list in the output of this command.) Example 11-7 Allowed VLAN List and the List of Active VLANs SW1# show interfaces trunk SW1# show interfaces F0/4 trunk Port Mode Encapsulation Status Native vlan Fa0/4 off 802.1q not-trunking 1 Port Vlans allowed on trunk Fa0/4 10-11 Port Vlans allowed and active in management domain Fa0/4 10-11 Port Vlans in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned Fa0/4 10-11 Summary: IP Telephony Ports on Switches It might seem like this short topic about IP telephony and switch configuration includes a lot of small twists and turns and trivia, and it does. The most important items to remember are as follows: Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs 267 11 ■ Configure these ports like a normal access port to begin: Configure it as a static access port and assign it an access VLAN. ■ Add one more command to define the voice VLAN (switchport voice vlan vlan-id). ■ Look for the mention of the voice VLAN ID, but no other new facts, in the output of the show interfaces type number switchport command. ■ Look for both the voice and data (access) VLAN IDs in the output of the show interfaces type number trunk command. ■ Do not expect to see the port listed in the list of operational trunks as listed by the show interfaces trunk command .

Verification refers to the process of confirming whether a network is working as designed. Trouble- shooting refers to the follow-on process that occurs when the network is not working as designed, by trying to determine the real reason why the network is not working correctly, so that it can be fixed. Sometimes, when people take their first Cisco exam, they are surprised at the number of verification and troubleshooting questions. Each of these questions requires you to apply networking knowledge to unique problems, rather than just being ready to answer questions about lists of facts that you’ve memorized. You need to have skills beyond simply remem- bering a lot of facts. To help you prepare to answer troubleshooting questions, this book, as well as the ICND2 book, devotes different book elements to troubleshooting. These book elements do not just list the configuration, and they do not just list example output from different show commands. Instead, these elements discuss how to use different commands to verify what should be happening, and if not, how to find the root cause of the problem. This chapter discusses a wide number of topics, many of which have already been discussed in Part II and the preceding chapters in Part III of the ICND1 book. First, this chapter begins with some perspectives on troubleshooting networking problems, because it is the first book element that focuses on troubleshooting, and because there is one exam topic that mentions the troubleshooting process and methods. At that point, this chapter looks at four key technical topics that matter to verifying and troubleshooting Ethernet LANs, as follows: ■ Analyzing switch interfaces and cabling ■ Predicting where switches will forward frames ■ Troubleshooting port security ■ Analyzing VLANs and VLAN trunks “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter. The answers are at the bottom of the page following the quiz, and the explanations are in DVD Appendix C and in the PCPT software.

Most of the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exam topics list the word “troubleshoot” along with some technology, mostly with some feature that you configure on a switch or router. One exam topic makes mention of the troubleshooting process. This first section examines the troubleshooting process as an end to itself. The first important perspective on the troubleshooting process is this: you can troubleshoot using any process or method that you want. However, all good methods have the same char- acteristics that result in faster resolution of the problem, and a better chance of avoiding that same problem in the future. The one exam topic that mentions troubleshooting methods uses some pretty common ter- minology found in troubleshooting methods both inside IT and in other industries as well. The ideas make good common sense. From the exam topics: Step 1. Problem isolation and documentation: Problem isolation refers to the pro- cess of taking what you know about a possible issue, confirming that there is a problem, and determining which devices and cables could be part of the problem, and which ones are not part of the problem. This step also works best when the person troubleshooting the problem documents what they find, typi- cally in a problem tracking system. Step 2. Resolve or escalate: Problem isolation should eventually uncover the root cause of the problem—that is, the cause which, if fixed, will resolve the prob- lem. In short, resolving the problem means finding the root cause of the prob- lem and fixing that problem. Of course, what do you do if you cannot find the root cause, or fix (resolve) that root cause once found? Escalate the problem. Most companies have a defined escalation process, with different levels of technical support and management support depending on whether the next step requires more technical expertise or management decision making. Step 3. Verify or monitor: You hear of a problem, you isolate the problem, document it, determine a possible root cause, and you try to resolve it. Now you need to verify that it really worked. In some cases, that may mean that you just do a few show commands. In other cases, you may need to keep an eye on it over a period of time, especially when you do not know what caused the root prob- lem in the first place. Like most real-life processes, the real troubleshooting process is seldom as neat as the three troubleshooting steps listed here. You move between them, you attempt to resolve the problem, it may or may not work, you work through the process over and over, get help from the escalation team as needed, and so on. But following these kinds of steps can help Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 C, D 2 A, B, D 3 A, D 4 B, D 5 B, C 6 A, C 7 B 8 D Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 275 12 you resolve problems more consistently, more quickly, especially when the team must get involved in troubleshooting a problem Troubleshooting on the Exams The exams ask you questions that not only assess your knowledge, but they assess your troubleshooting skills. To do that, the exam does not require you to follow any particular troubleshooting methods. On the exam, you should focus on isolating the root cause of the problem, after which you will either (a) fix the problem or (b) answer a multichoice question about the symptoms and the root cause of the problem. The exam uses two question types as the primary means to test troubleshooting skills. Sim questions begin with a broken configuration; your job is to find the configuration problem, and answer the question by fixing or completing the configuration. These are straightfor- ward configuration troubleshooting questions, and you can recognize them on the exam when the exam tells you to answer the question by changing the configuration. Simlet questions also give you a simulator where you access the command-line interface (CLI). However, instead of changing the configuration, these questions require you to verify the current operation of the network and then answer multichoice questions about the cur- rent operation. These questions make you do the same kinds of commands you would use when doing problem isolation and documentation, and then assess what you found by ask- ing you several multichoice questions. At some point, whether you stop now or sometime when you have 10 to 15 spare minutes, take the time to search Cisco.com for “exam tutorial.” Cisco’s exam tutorial shows all the question types, including Sim and Simlet types, and you can take over the user interface to get a better sense for how to navigate in the same user interface you will see on exam day. A Deeper Look at Problem Isolation On the exam, you may do 5–10 show commands in a Simlet question before finding all the answers to all the multichoice questions within that one Simlet question. So it sometimes helps to go through problem isolation like what you would do in a real network. In some questions, it may be obvious that the problem will be something to do with the switches or VLANs, but in others, you may have to do extra problem isolation work to even determine whether the problem is a WAN or LAN or routing problem, and which part of the network has the problem. For example, consider the following problem based on the network in Figure 12-1. PC1 and PC2 supposedly sit in the same VLAN (10). At one time, the ping 10.1.1.2 command on PC1 worked; now it does not. 1 2 10.1.1.1 0200.1111.1111 VLAN10 10.1.1.2 0200.2222.2222 F0/1 G0/1SW1 G0/2 F0/2SW2 Figure 12-1 Network with a Ping Problem 276 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide NOTE This book covers two IP troubleshooting tools—ping and traceroute—in depth in Chapter 23, “IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools.” For now, know that the ping command sends messages (inside IPv4 packets) that flow from one device to the other, and back, to test whether the IP network can deliver packets in both directions. So, how do you attack this problem? If you doubt whether the figure is even correct, you could look at show command output to confirm the network topology. After it is con- firmed, you could predict its normal working behavior based on your knowledge of LAN switching. As a result, you could predict where a frame sent by PC1 to PC2 should flow. To isolate the problem, you could look in the switch MAC tables to confirm the interfaces out which the frame should be forwarded, possibly then finding that the interface connected to PC2 has failed. This first problem showed a relatively small network, with only two networking devices (two Layer 2 switches). As a result, you would probably guess that the exam question focused on either interface issues or VLAN issues or something you read in Part II and the previous chapters of Part III of this book. Other Simlet questions might instead begin with a larger network, but they might still require you to do problem isolation about the Ethernet topics in Parts II and III. However, that problem isolation might need to start with Layer 3, just to decide where to begin look- ing for other problems. For example, the user of PC1 in Figure 12-2 can usually connect to the web server on the right by entering www.example.com in PC1’s web browser. However, that web-browsing attempt fails right now. The user calls the help desk, and the problem is assigned to a net- work engineer to solve. 1 2 3 6 5 4 Example.com Web Server SW1 SW2 SW3R1 R2 PC1 Figure 12-2 Layer 3 Problem Isolation To begin the analysis, the network engineer can begin with the first tasks that would have to happen for a successful web-browsing session to occur. For example, the engineer would try to confirm that PC1 can resolve the hostname (www.example.com) to the correct IP address used by the server on the right. At that point, the Layer 3 IP problem isolation pro- cess can proceed, to determine which of the six routing steps shown in the figure has failed. The routing steps shown in Figure 12-2 are as follows: Step 1. PC1 sends the packet to its default gateway (R1) because the destination IP address (of the web server) is in a different subnet. Step 2. R1 forwards the packet to R2 based on R1’s routing table. Step 3. R2 forwards the packet to the web server based on R2’s routing table. http://www.example.com http://www.example.com Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 277 12 Step 4. The web server sends a packet back toward PC1 based on the web server’s default gateway setting (R2). Step 5. R2 forwards the packet destined for PC1 by forwarding the packet to R1 according to R2’s routing table. Step 6. R1 forwards the packet to PC1 based on R1’s routing table. Many engineers break down network problems as in this list, analyzing the Layer 3 path through the network, hop by hop, in both directions. This process helps you take the first attempt at problem isolation. When the analysis shows which hop in the layer path fails, you can then look further at those details. And if in this case the Layer 3 problem isolation process discovers that Step 1, 3, 4, or 6 fails, the root cause might be related to Ethernet or other Layer 2 issues. For example, imagine that the Layer 3 analysis determined that PC1 cannot even send a packet to its default gateway (R1), meaning that Step 1 in Figure 12-2 fails. To further isolate the problem and find the root causes, the engineer would need to determine the following: ■ The MAC address of PC1 and of R1’s LAN interface ■ The switch interfaces used on SW1 and SW2 ■ The interface status of each switch interface ■ The VLANs that should be used ■ The expected forwarding behavior of a frame sent by PC1 to R1 as the destination MAC address By gathering and analyzing these facts, the engineer can most likely isolate the problem’s root cause and fix it. Troubleshooting as Covered in This Book All the exams related to CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching include a variety of troubleshooting topics. In the current version of the ICND1 and ICND2 exam topics, Cisco lists around 30 specific major exam topics that include the word “troubleshoot.” As a result, this book has three complete chapters devoted to troubleshooting, plus other smaller trou- bleshooting topics spread throughout different chapters. Plus, every concept, configuration, and verification topic helps you learn the background information required to troubleshoot that feature. The rest of this chapter examines troubleshooting related to Ethernet LANs, with four major topics. All of the topics discuss familiar concepts, with familiar configuration and verifica- tion commands. However, in earlier configuration and verification discussions of these top- ics, the point was to show how to configure correctly and how to verify correct operation. In this case, the text takes a troubleshooting approach, looking for typical problems and how to isolate network problems by paying even more attention to the verification details. The topics include the following: ■ Examining interface status and statistics: Interfaces must be in a working state before a switch will forward frames on the interface. You must determine whether an interface is working, as well as determine the potential root causes for a failed switch interface. 278 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide ■ Analyzing where switches will forward frames: You must know how to analyze a switch’s MAC address table and how to then predict how a switch will forward a particu- lar frame. ■ Analyzing port security: Port security can disable an interface if a violation occurs—but it can also filter frames while leaving the interface up. This section examines how to know what behavior will happen when a violation occurs, and how to know if it is hap- pening right now or not. ■ Analyzing VLANs and VLAN trunking: Keeping a Layer 2 switch focus, this last section looks at what can go wrong with VLANs and VLAN trunks. Analyzing Switch Interface Status and Statistics This section makes the transition from the process focus of the previous section to the first of four technology-focused sections of this chapter. That process begins with finding out whether each switch interface works, and if working, whether any statistics reveal any additional problems. Unsurprisingly, Cisco switches do not use interfaces at all unless the interface is first considered to be in a functional or working state. In addition, the switch interface might be in a working state, but intermittent problems might still be occurring. This section begins by looking at the Cisco switch interface status codes and what they mean so that you can know whether an interface is working. The rest of this section then looks at those more unusual cases in which the interface is working, but not working well, as revealed by different interface status codes and statistics. Interface Status Codes and Reasons for Nonworking States Cisco switches actually use two different sets of interface status codes—one set of two codes (words) that use the same conventions as do router interface status codes, and anoth- er set with a single code (word). Both sets of status codes can determine whether an inter- face is working. The switch show interfaces and show interfaces description commands list the two-code status named the line status and protocol status. The line status generally refers to whether Layer 1 is working, with protocol status generally referring to whether Layer 2 is working. NOTE This book refers to these two status codes in shorthand by just listing the two codes with a slash between them, such as up/up. The single-code interface status corresponds to different combinations of the traditional two-code interface status codes and can be easily correlated to those codes. For example, the show interfaces status command lists a connected state for working interfaces, with the same meaning as the up/up state seen with the show interfaces and show interfaces description commands. Table 12-2 lists the code combinations and some root causes that could have caused a particular interface status. Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 279 12 Table 12-2 LAN Switch Interface Status Codes Line Status Protocol Status Interface Status Typical Root Cause administratively down down disabled The shutdown command is configured on the interface. down down notconnect No cable; bad cable; wrong cable pinouts; speed mismatch; neighboring device is (a) powered off, (b) shutdown, or (c) error disabled. up down notconnect Not expected on LAN switch physical interfaces. down down (err-disabled) err-disabled Port security has disabled the interface. up up connected The interface is working. Examining the notconnect state for a moment, note that this state has many causes that have been mentioned through this book. For example, using incorrect cabling pinouts, instead of the correct pinouts explained in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” causes a problem. However, one topic can be particularly difficult to troubleshoot—the possibility for both speed and duplex mismatches, as explained in the next section. As you can see in the table, having a bad cable is just one of many reasons for the down/down state (or notconnect, per the show interfaces status command). Some examples of the root causes of cabling problems include the following: ■ The installation of any equipment that uses electricity, even non-IT equipment, can inter- fere with the transmission on the cabling, and make the link fail. ■ The cable could be damaged, for example, if it lies under carpet. If the user’s chair keeps squashing the cable, eventually the electrical signal can degrade. ■ Although optical cables do not suffer from electromagnetic interference (EMI), some- one can try to be helpful and move a fiber-optic cable out of the way—bending it too much. A bend into too tight a shape can prevent the cable from transmitting bits (called macrobending). For the other interface states listed in Table 12-2, only the up/up (connected) state needs more discussion. An interface can be in a working state, and it might really be working— or it might be working in a degraded state. The next few topics discuss how to examine an up/up (connected) interface to find out whether it is working well or having problems. Interface Speed and Duplex Issues Many unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)-based Ethernet interfaces support multiple speeds, either full or half duplex, and support IEEE standard autonegotiation (as discussed in Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” in the section “Autonegotiation”). These same interfaces can also be configured to use a specific speed using the speed {10 | 100 | 1000} interface subcommand, and a specific duplex using the duplex {half | full} interface subcom- mand. With both configured, a switch or router disables the IEEE-standard autonegotiation process on that interface. 280 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The show interfaces and show interfaces status commands list both the actual speed and duplex settings on an interface, as demonstrated in Example 12-1.

The com- mand output lists autonegotiated settings with a prefix of a-. For example, a-full means full duplex as autonegotiated, whereas full means full duplex but as manually configured. The example shades the command output that implies that the switch’s Fa0/12 interface’s speed and duplex were not found through autonegotiation, but Fa0/13 did use autonegotiation. Note that the show interfaces fa0/13 command (without the status option) simply lists the speed and duplex for interface Fast Ethernet 0/13, with nothing implying that the values were learned through autonegotiation. When the IEEE autonegotiation process works on both devices, both devices agree to the fastest speed supported by both devices. In addition, the devices use full duplex if it is sup- ported by both devices, or half duplex if it is not. However, when one device has disabled autonegotiation, and the other device uses autonegotiation, the device using autonegotia- tion chooses the default duplex setting based on the current speed. The defaults are as fol- lows: ■ If the speed is not known through any means, use 10 Mbps, half duplex. ■ If the switch successfully senses the speed without IEEE autonegotiation, by just looking at the signal on the cable: ■ If the speed is 10 or 100 Mbps, default to use half duplex. ■ If the speed is 1,000 Mbps, default to use full duplex. NOTE Ethernet interfaces using speeds faster than 1 Gbps always use full duplex. While autonegotiation works well, these defaults allow for the possibility of a difficult-to- troubleshoot problem called a duplex mismatch. The “Autonegotiation” section in Chapter 9 explains how both devices could use the same speed, so the devices would consider the link to be up, but one side would use half-duplex and the other side would use full duplex. The next example shows a specific case that causes a duplex mismatch. In Figure 12-3, imagine that SW2’s Gi0/2 interface was configured with the speed 100 and duplex full commands (these settings are not recommended on a Gigabit-capable interface, by the way). On Cisco switches, configuring both the speed and duplex commands disables IEEE auto- negotiation on that port. If SW1’s Gi0/1 interface tries to use autonegotiation, SW1 would also use a speed of 100 Mbps, but default to use half duplex. Example 12-2 shows the results of this specific case on SW1. 282 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide 0200.1111.1111 0200.0101.0101 Fa0/11 Fa0/1Gi0/1 Fa0/10Gi0/2 SW1 SW2 R1 PC1 speed 100 duplex full Autonegotiation Fails Autonegotiation Is Disabled Figure 12-3 Conditions to Create a Duplex Mismatch Between SW1 and SW2 Example 12-2 Confirming Duplex Mismatch on Switch SW1 SW1# show interfaces gi0/1 status Port Name Status Vlan Duplex Speed Type Gi0/1 connected trunk a-half a-100 10/100/1000BaseTX First , focusing on the command output, the command confirms SW1’s speed and duplex. It also lists a prefix of a- in the output, implying autonegotiation. Even with SW1 using auto- negotiation defaults, the command still notes the values as being learned through autonego- tiation. Finding a duplex mismatch can be much more difficult than finding a speed mismatch, because if the duplex settings do not match on the ends of an Ethernet segment, the switch interface will still be in a connected (up/up) state. In this case, the interface works, but it might work poorly, with poor performance, and with symptoms of intermittent prob- lems. The reason is that the device using half-duplex uses carrier sense multiple access col- lision detect (CSMA/CD) logic, waiting to send when receiving a frame, believing collisions occur when they physically do not—and actually stopping sending a frame because the switch thinks a collision occurred. With enough traffic load, the interface could be in a con- nect state, but it’s extremely inefficient for passing traffic. To identify duplex mismatch problems, check the duplex setting on each end of the link and watch for incrementing collision and late collision counters, as explained in the next section. Common Layer 1 Problems on Working Interfaces When the interface reaches the connect (up/up) state, the switch considers the interface to be working. The switch, of course, tries to use the interface, and at the same time, the switch keeps various interface counters. These interface counters can help identify problems that can occur even though the interface is in a connect state. This section explains some of the related concepts and a few of the most common problems. Whenever the physical transmission has problems, the receiving device might receive a frame whose bits have changed values. These frames do not pass the error detection logic as implemented in the FCS field in the Ethernet trailer, as covered in Chapter 2. The receiving device discards the frame and counts it as some kind of input error. Cisco switches list this error as a CRC error, as highlighted in Example 12-3. (Cyclic redundancy check [CRC] is a term related to how the frame check sequence [FCS] math detects an error.) Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 283 12 Example 12-3 Interface Counters for Layer 1 Problems SW1# show interfaces fa0/13 ! lines omitted for brevity Received 284 broadcasts (0 multicast) 0 runts, 0 giants, 0 throttles 0 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored 0 watchdog, 281 multicast, 0 pause input 0 input packets with dribble condition detected 95226 packets output, 10849674 bytes, 0 underruns 0 output errors, 0 collisions, 1 interface resets 0 unknown protocol drops 0 babbles, 0 late collision, 0 deferred 0 lost carrier, 0 no carrier, 0 PAUSE output 0 output buffer failures, 0 output buffers swapped out The number of input errors, and the number of CRC errors, are just a few of the counters in the output of the show interfaces command. The challenge is to decide which counters you need to think about, which ones show that a problem is happening, and which ones are normal and of no concern. The example highlights several of the counters as examples so that you can start to under- stand which ones point to problems and which ones are just counting normal events that are not problems. The following list shows a short description of each highlighted counter, in the order shown in the example: Runts: Frames that did not meet the minimum frame size requirement (64 bytes, including the 18-byte destination MAC, source MAC, type, and FCS). Can be caused by collisions. Giants: Frames that exceed the maximum frame size requirement (1518 bytes, including the 18-byte destination MAC, source MAC, type, and FCS). Input Errors: A total of many counters, including runts, giants, no buffer, CRC, frame, overrun, and ignored counts. CRC: Received frames that did not pass the FCS math; can be caused by collisions. Frame: Received frames that have an illegal format, for example, ending with a partial byte; can be caused by collisions. Packets Output: Total number of packets (frames) forwarded out the interface. Output Errors: Total number of packets (frames) that the switch port tried to transmit, but for which some problem occurred. Collisions: Counter of all collisions that occur when the interface is transmitting a frame. Late Collisions: The subset of all collisions that happen after the 64th byte of the frame has been transmitted. (In a properly working Ethernet LAN, collisions should occur with- in the first 64 bytes; late collisions today often point to a duplex mismatch.) Note that many of these counters occur as part of the CSMA/CD process used when half duplex is enabled. Collisions occur as a normal part of the half-duplex logic imposed by CSMA/CD, so a switch interface with an increasing collisions counter might not even have a problem. However, one problem, called late collisions, points to the classic duplex mismatch problem. 284 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide If a LAN design follows cabling guidelines, all collisions should occur by the end of the 64th byte of any frame. When a switch has already sent 64 bytes of a frame, and the switch receives a frame on that same interface, the switch senses a collision. In this case, the colli- sion is a late collision, and the switch increments the late collision counter in addition to the usual CSMA/CD actions to send a jam signal, wait a random time, and try again. With a duplex mismatch, like the mismatch between SW1 and SW2 in Figure 12-3, the half- duplex interface will likely see the late collisions counter increment. Why? The half-duplex interface sends a frame (SW1), but the full duplex neighbor (SW2) sends at any time, even after the 64th byte of the frame sent by the half-duplex switch. So, just keep repeating the show interfaces command, and if you see the late collisions counter incrementing on a half- duplex interface, you might have a duplex mismatch problem. A working interface (in an up/up state) can still suffer from issues related to the physical cabling as well. The cabling problems might not be bad enough to cause a complete failure, but the transmission failures result in some frames failing to pass successfully over the cable. For example, excessive interference on the cable can cause the various input error counters to keep growing larger, especially the CRC counter. In particular, if the CRC errors grow, but the collisions counters do not, the problem might simply be interference on the cable. (The switch counts each collided frame as one form of input error as well.) Predicting Where Switches Will Forward Frames This section begins the fourth of five major sections in this chapter. This section looks at a key part of the troubleshooting process for Ethernet LANs: predicting where frames should go in the LAN so that you can compare what should happen versus what is actually happen- ing in a LAN. Predicting the Contents of the MAC Address Table As explained in Chapter 7, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching,” switches learn MAC addresses and then use the entries in the MAC address table to make a forwarding/filtering decision for each frame. To know exactly how a particular switch will forward an Ethernet frame, you need to examine the MAC address table on a Cisco switch. The more formal troubleshooting process begins with a mental process where you predict where frames should flow in the LAN. As an exercise, review Figure 12-4 and try to create a MAC address table on paper for each switch. Include the MAC addresses for both PCs, as well as the Gi0/1 MAC address for R1. (Assume that all three are assigned to VLAN 10.) Then predict which interfaces would be used to forward a frame sent by Fred, Barney, and R1 to every other device. Gi0/1 Gi0/2 Fa0/12Fa0/9 Fa0/13 Gi0/1 0200.5555.5555 SW1 SW2 R1 Barney 0200.2222.2222 Fred 0200.1111.1111 Figure 12-4 Sample Network Used in Switch MAC Learning Examples Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 285 12 The MAC table entries you predict in this case define where you think frames will flow. Even though this sample network in Figure 12-4 shows only one physical path through the Ethernet LAN, the exercise should be worthwhile, because it forces you to correlate what you’d expect to see in the MAC address table with how the switches forward frames. Figure 12-5 shows the resulting MAC table entries for PCs Fred and Barney, as well as for Router R1. Gi0/1 Gi0/2 Barney 0200.2222.2222 Fa0/12Fa0/9 Fa0/13 Gi0/1 0200.5555.5555 SW1 SW2 R1 0200.1111.1111 0200.2222.2222 0200.5555.5555 AddressVLAN 10 10 10 Fa0/9 Fa0/12 Gi0/1 Interface 0200.1111.1111 0200.2222.2222 0200.5555.5555 AddressVLAN 10 10 10 Gi0/2 Gi0/2 Fa0/13 Interface SW1 MAC Table SW2 MAC Table Fred 0200.1111.1111 Figure 12-5 Predictions for MAC Table Entries on SW1 and SW2 While Figure 12-5 shows the concepts, Example 12-4 lists the same facts but in the form of the show mac address-table dynamic command on the switches. This command lists all dynamically learned MAC table entries on a switch, for all VLANs. Example 12-4 Examining SW1 and SW2 Dynamic MAC Address Table Entries SW1# show mac address-table dynamic Mac Address Table ------------------------------------------- Vlan Mac Address Type Ports ---- ----------- -------- ----- 10 0200.1111.1111 DYNAMIC Fa0/9 10 0200.2222.2222 DYNAMIC Fa0/12 10 0200.5555.5555 DYNAMIC Gi0/1 SW2# show mac address-table dynamic Mac Address Table ------------------------------------------- Vlan Mac Address Type Ports ---- ----------- -------- ----- 10 0200.1111.1111 DYNAMIC Gi0/2 10 0200.2222.2222 DYNAMIC Gi0/2 10 0200.5555.5555 DYNAMIC Fa0/13 286 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide When predicting the MAC address table entries, you need to imagine a frame sent by a device to another device on the other side of the LAN and then determine which switch ports the frame would enter as it passes through the LAN. For example, if Barney sends a frame to Router R1, the frame would enter SW1’s Fa0/12 interface, so SW1 has a MAC table entry that lists Barney’s 0200.2222.2222 MAC address with Fa0/12. SW1 would for- ward Barney’s frame to SW2, arriving on SW2’s Gi0/2 interface, so SW2’s MAC table lists Barney’s MAC address (0200.2222.2222) with interface Gi0/2 . After you predict the expected contents of the MAC address tables, you can then examine what is actually happening on the switches, as described in the next section. Analyzing the Forwarding Path Troubleshooting revolves around three big ideas: predicting what should happen, determin- ing what is happening that is different than what should happen, and figuring out why that different behavior is happening. This next section discusses how to look at what is actually happening in a VLAN based on those MAC address tables, first using a summary of switch forwarding logic and then showing an example. The following list summarizes switch forwarding logic including the LAN switching features discussed in this book: Step 1. Process functions on the incoming interface, if the interface is currently in an up/up (connected) state, as follows: A. If configured, apply port security logic to filter the frame as appropriate. B. If the port is an access port, determine the interface’s access VLAN. C. If the port is a trunk, determine the frame’s tagged VLAN. Step 2. Make a forwarding decision. Look for the frame’s destination MAC address in the MAC address table, but only for entries in the VLAN identified in Step 1. If the destination MAC is… A. Found (unicast), forward the frame out the only interface listed in the matched address table entry. B. Not found (unicast), flood the frame out all other access ports (except the incoming port) in that same VLAN, plus out trunks that have not restricted the VLAN from that trunk (as discussed in Chapter 11, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” as related to the show interfaces trunk command). C. Broadcast, flood the frame, with the same rules as the previous step. For an example of this process, consider a frame sent by Barney to its default gateway, R1 (0200.5555.5555). Using the steps just listed, the following occurs: Step 1. Input interface processing: A. The port does not happen to have port security enabled. B. SW1 receives the frame on its Fa0/12 interface, an access port in VLAN 10. Step 2. Make a forwarding decision: SW1 looks in its MAC address table for entries in VLAN 10: A. SW1 finds an entry (known unicast) for 0200.5555.5555, associated with VLAN 10, outgoing interface Gi0/1, so SW1 forwards the frame only out interface Gi0/1. (This link is a VLAN trunk, so SW1 adds a VLAN 10 tag to the 802.1Q trunking header.) Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 287 12 At this point, the frame with source 0200.2222.2222 (Barney) and destination 0200.5555.5555 (R1) is on its way to SW2. You can then apply the same logic for SW2, as follows: Step 1. Input interface processing: A. The port does not happen to have port security enabled. B. SW2 receives the frame on its Gi0/2 interface, a trunk; the frame lists a tag of VLAN 10. (SW2 will remove the 802.1Q header as well.) Step 2. Make a forwarding decision: SW2 looks for its MAC table for entries in VLAN 10: A. SW2 finds an entry (known unicast) for 0200.5555.5555, associated with VLAN 10, outgoing interface Fa0/13, so SW2 forwards the frame only out interface Fa0/13. At this point, the frame should be on its way, over the Ethernet cable between SW2 and R1. Analyzing Port Security Operations on an Interface Generally speaking, any analysis of the forwarding process should consider any security features that might discard some frames or packets. For example, both routers and switches can be configured with access control lists (ACL) that examine the packets and frames being sent or received on an interface, with the router or switch discarding those packets/frames. This book does not include coverage of switch ACLs, but the exams do cover a switch fea- ture called port security. As covered in the ICND1 book’s Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” the port security feature can be used to cause the switch to discard some frames sent into and out of an interface. Port security has three basic features with which it deter- mines which frames to filter: ■ Limit which specific MAC addresses can send and receive frames on a switch interface, discarding frames to/from other MAC addresses ■ Limit the number of MAC addresses using the interface, discarding frames to/from MAC addresses learned after the maximum limit is reached ■ A combination of the previous two points The first port security troubleshooting step should be to find which interfaces have port security enabled, followed by a determination as to whether any violations are currently occurring. The trickiest part relates to the differences in what the IOS does in reaction to violations based on the switchport port-security violation violation-mode interface sub- command, which tells the switch what to do when a violation occurs. The general process to find port security issues is as follows: Step 1. Identify all interfaces on which port security is enabled (show running-config or show port-security). Step 2. Determine whether a security violation is currently occurring based in part on the violation mode of the interface’s port security configuration, as follows: A. shutdown: The interface will be in an err-disabled state, and the port secu- rity port status will be secure-down. 288 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide B. restrict: The interface will be in a connected state, the port security port status will be secure-up, but the show port-security interface command will show an incrementing violations counter. C. protect: The interface will be in a connected state, and the show port-security interface command will not show an incrementing violations counter. Step 3. In all cases, compare the port security configuration to the diagram and to the Last Source Address field in the output of the show port-security interface command. Because IOS reacts so differently with shutdown mode as compared to restrict and protect modes, the next few pages explain the differences—first for shutdown mode, then for the other two modes. Troubleshooting Shutdown Mode and Err-disabled Recovery Troubleshooting Step 2A refers to the interface err-disabled (error-disabled) state. This state verifies that the interface has been configured to use port security, that a violation has occurred, and that no traffic is allowed on the interface at the present time. This interface state implies that the shutdown violation mode is used, because it is the only one of the three port security modes that causes the interface to be disabled. To recover from an err-disabled state, the interface must be shut down with the shutdown command, and then enabled with the no shutdown command. Example 12-5 lists an exam- ple in which the interface is in an err-disabled state. Example 12-5 Using Port Security to Define Correct MAC Addresses of Particular Interfaces ! The first command lists all interfaces on which port security has been enabled, ! and the violation mode, under the heading \"Security Action.\" SW1# show port-security Secure Port MaxSecureAddr CurrentAddr SecurityViolation Security Action (Count) (Count) (Count) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fa0/13 1 1 1 Shutdown --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Addresses in System (excluding one mac per port) : 0 Max Addresses limit in System (excluding one mac per port) : 8192 ! !

The next command’s output has shading for several of the most important facts.

The port status of secure-shutdown means that the interface is disabled for all traffic as a result of a violation while in port security shutdown mode; this state is not used by the protect and restrict modes. The port security port status of secure- shutdown also means that the interface state should be err-disabled. Note that in shutdown mode, the violations counter (at the bottom of the output) does not keep incrementing. Basically, once the first violating frame triggers IOS to move the port to an err-disabled state, IOS ignores any other incoming frames (not even counting them) until the engineer uses the shutdown and no shutdown commands on the interface, in succes- sion. Note that the process of recovering the interface also resets the violation counter back to 0. Finally, note that the second-to-last line lists the source MAC address of the last frame received on the interface. This value can prove useful in identifying the MAC address of the device that caused the violation. Figure 12-6 summarizes these behaviors, assuming the same scenario shown in the example. F0/13: Status: Err-disabled show port-security interface 10X Source: MAC1 Secure-Down Counter: 1 Syslog: 10 Msgs Last MAC: MAC1 Figure 12-6 Summary of Actions: Port Security Violation Mode Shutdown Troubleshooting Restrict and Protect Modes The restrict and protect violation modes take a much different approach to securing ports. These modes still discard offending traffic, but the interface remains in a connected (up/ up) state, and in a port security state of secure-up. As a result, the port continues to forward good traffic and discard offending traffic. 290 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Having a port in a seemingly good state that also discards traffic can be a challenge when troubleshooting. Basically, you have to know about this possible pitfall, and then know how to tell when port security is discarding some traffic on a port even though the interface sta- tus looks good. The show port-security interface command reveals whether protect mode has discarded frames using the “last source address” item in the output. Example 12-6 shows a sample con- figuration and show command when using protect mode. In this case, the port is configured to allow Fa0/13 to receive frames sent by 0200.1111.1111 only. Ten frames have arrived, with a variety of source MAC addresses, with the last frame’s source MAC address being 0200.3333.3333. Example 12-6 Port Security Using Protect Mode SW1# show running-config ! Lines omitted for brevity interface FastEthernet0/13 switchport mode access switchport port-security switchport port-security mac-address 0200.1111.1111 switchport port-security violation protect !

For instance, in this case, this show command output was gathered after many frames had been sent by a PC with MAC address 0200.3333.3333, with all the frames being discarded by the switch because of port security. The command output shows the disallowed PC’s 0200.3333.3333 MAC address as the last source MAC address in a received frame. However, if another frame with an allowed MAC address arrived (in this case, source MAC 0200.1111.1111), the next instance of the show command would list 0200.1111.1111 as the last source address. In particular, note that the interface remains in a secure-up state, and the violation counter does not increment. Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 291 12 Figure 12-7 summarizes the key points about the operation of Port Security protect mode, assuming a mix of frames with different source addresses. The figure emphasizes unpredict- ability of the last source MAC listed in the output, and the fact that the counter does not increment and that no syslog messages are generated for violating frames. F0/13: Status: Connected show port-security interface 10x Source: Various Secure-Up Counter: 0 Syslog: NO Last MAC: ??? Figure 12-7 Summary of Actions: Port Security Violation Mode Protect If this example had used violation mode restrict instead of protect, the port status would have also remained in a secure-up state; however, IOS would show some indication of port security activity, such as the incrementing violation counter as well as syslog messages. Example 12-7 shows an example of the violation counter and ends with an example port security syslog message. In this case, 97 incoming frames so far violated the rules, with the most recent frame having a source MAC address of 0200.3333.3333.

Figure 12-8 summarizes the key points about the restrict mode for port security. In this case, the figure matches the same scenario as the example again, with 97 total violating frames arriving so far, with the most recent being from source MAC MAC3. 292 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide F0/13: Status: Connected show port-security interface 97X Source: MAC3 Secure-Up Counter: +97 Syslog: 97 Msgs Last MAC: MAC3 Figure 12-8 Summary of Actions: Port Security Violation Mode Restrict For the exams, a port security violation might not be a problem; it might be the exact func- tion intended. The question text might well explicitly state what port security should be doing. In these cases, it can be quicker to just immediately look at the port security configu- ration. Then, compare the configuration to the MAC addresses of the devices connected to the interface. The most likely problem on the exams is that the MAC addresses have been misconfigured or that the maximum number of MAC addresses has been set too low. Analyzing VLANs and VLAN Trunks A switch’s forwarding process, as discussed earlier in the section “Analyzing the Forwarding Path,” depends in part on VLANs and VLAN trunking. Before a switch can forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must know about a VLAN and the VLAN must be active. And before a switch can forward a frame over a VLAN trunk, the trunk must currently allow that VLAN to pass over the trunk. This final of the five major sections in this chap- ter focuses on VLAN and VLAN trunking issues, specifically issues that impact the frame switching process. The four potential issues are as follows: Step 1. Identify all access interfaces and their assigned access VLANs and reassign into the correct VLANs as needed. Step 2. Determine whether the VLANs both exist (configured or learned with VTP) and are active on each switch. If not, configure and activate the VLANs to resolve problems as needed. Step 3. Check the allowed VLAN lists, on the switches on both ends of the trunk, and ensure that the lists of allowed VLANs are the same. Step 4. Check for incorrect configuration settings that result in one switch operating as a trunk, with the neighboring switch not operating as a trunk. Ensuring That the Right Access Interfaces Are in the Right VLANs To ensure that each access interface has been assigned to the correct VLAN, engineers simply need to determine which switch interfaces are access interfaces instead of trunk interfaces, determine the assigned access VLANs on each interface, and compare the infor- mation to the documentation. The show commands listed in Table 12-3 can be particularly helpful in this process. Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 293 12 Table 12-3 Commands That Can Find Access Ports and VLANs EXEC Command Description show vlan brief show vlan Lists each VLAN and all interfaces assigned to that VLAN (but does not include operational trunks) show vlan id num Lists both access and trunk ports in the VLAN show interfaces type number switchport Identifies the interface’s access VLAN and voice VLAN, plus the configured and operational mode (access or trunk) show mac address-table Lists MAC table entries, including the associated VLAN If possible, start this step with the show vlan and show vlan brief commands, because they list all the known VLANs and the access interfaces assigned to each VLAN. Be aware, how- ever, that these two commands do not list operational trunks. The output does list all other interfaces (those not currently trunking), no matter whether the interface is in a working or nonworking state. If the show vlan and show interface switchport commands are not available in a particular exam question, the show mac address-table command can also help identify the access VLAN. This command lists the MAC address table, with each entry including a MAC address, interface, and VLAN ID. If the exam question implies that a switch interface con- nects to a single device PC, you should only see one MAC table entry that lists that par- ticular access interface; the VLAN ID listed for that same entry identifies the access VLAN. (You cannot make such assumptions for trunking interfaces.) After you determine the access interfaces and associated VLANs, if the interface is assigned to the wrong VLAN, use the switchport access vlan vlan-id interface subcommand to assign the correct VLAN ID. Access VLANs Not Being Defined Switches do not forward frames for VLANs that are (a) not configured or (b) configured but disabled (shut down). This section summarizes the best ways to confirm that a switch knows that a particular VLAN exists, and if it exists, determines the state of the VLAN. First, on the issue of whether a VLAN is defined, a VLAN can be defined to a switch in two ways: using the vlan number global configuration command, or it can be learned from another switch using VTP. This book purposefully ignores VTP as much as possible, so for this discussion, consider that the only way for a switch to know about a VLAN is to have a vlan command configured on the local switch. Next, the show vlan command always lists all VLANs known to the switch, but the show running-config command does not. Switches configured as VTP servers and clients do not list the vlan commands in the running-config nor the startup-config file; on these switches, you must use the show vlan command. Switches configured to use VTP transparent mode, or that disable VTP, list the vlan configuration commands in the configuration files. (Use the show vtp status command to learn the current VTP mode of a switch.) After you determine that a VLAN does not exist, the problem might be that the VLAN sim- ply needs to be defined. If so, follow the VLAN configuration process as covered in detail in Chapter 11 . 294 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Access VLANs Being Disabled For any existing VLANs, also verify whether the VLAN is active. The show vlan command should list one of two VLAN state values, depending on the current state: either active or act/lshut. The second of these states means that the VLAN is shut down. Shutting down a VLAN disables the VLAN on that switch only, so that the switch will not forward frames in that VLAN. Switch IOS gives you two similar configuration methods with which to disable (shutdown) and enable (no shutdown) a VLAN. Example 12-8 shows how, first by using the global command [no] shutdown vlan number and then using the VLAN mode subcommand [no] shutdown. The example shows the global commands enabling and disabling VLANs 10 and 20, respectively, and using VLAN subcommands to enable and disable VLANs 30 and 40 (respectively).

However, trunks can also be misconfigured, with a couple of different results. In some cases, both switches conclude that their interfaces do not trunk. In other cases, one switch believes that its interface is correctly trunking, while the other switch does not. The most common incorrect configuration—which results in both switches not trunking—is a configuration that uses the switchport mode dynamic auto command on both switches on Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Ethernet LANs 295 12 the link. The word “auto” just makes us all want to think that the link would trunk automati- cally, but this command is both automatic and passive. As a result, both switches passively wait on the other device on the link to begin negotiations. With this particular incorrect configuration, the show interfaces switchport command on both switches confirms both the administrative state (auto), as well as the fact that both switches operate as “static access” ports. Example 12-9 highlights those parts of the output from this command. Example 12-9 Operational Trunking State SW2# show interfaces gigabit0/2 switchport Name: Gi0/2 Switchport: Enabled Administrative Mode: dynamic auto Operational Mode: static access Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native ! lines omitted for brevity A different incorrect trunking configuration results in one switch with an operational state of “trunk,” while the other switch has an operational state of “static access.” When this com- bination of events happens, the interface works a little. The status on each end will be up/up or connected. Traffic in the native VLAN will actually cross the link successfully. However, traffic in all the rest of the VLANs will not cross the link. Figure 12-9 shows the incorrect configuration along with which side trunks and which does not. The side that trunks (SW1 in this case) enables trunking always, using the command switchport mode trunk. However, this command does not disable DTP negotiations. To cause this particular problem, SW1 also disables DTP negotiation using the switchport nonegotiate command. SW2’s configuration also helps create the problem, by using a trunk- ing option that relies on DTP. Because SW1 has disabled DTP, SW2’s DTP negotiations fail, and SW2 does not trunk.

Frame 21 Trunk Mode: On Trunk Mode: Access Figure 12-9 Mismatched Trunking Operational States In this case, SW1 treats its G0/1 interface as a trunk, and SW2 treats its G0/2 interface as an access port (not a trunk). As shown in the figure at Step 1, SW1 could (for example) forward a frame in VLAN 10 (Step 1). However, SW2 would view any frame that arrives with an 802.1Q header as illegal, because SW2 treats its G0/2 port as an access port. So, SW2 dis- cards any 802.1Q frames received on that port. 296 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide To deal with the possibility of this problem, always check the trunk’s operational state on both sides of the trunk. The best commands to check trunking-related facts are show interfaces trunk and show interfaces switchport. NOTE Frankly, in real life, just avoid this kind of configuration. However, the switches do not prevent you from making these types of mistakes, so you need to be ready.

Part III Review Review Key Topics Review all key topics in all chapters in this part, either by browsing the chapters or by using the Key Topics application on the DVD or companion website. Create Terminology, Command, and Troubleshooting Causes Mind Maps Part III of this book discusses the more advanced Ethernet concepts for this book, but from many directions: design, implementation, and troubleshooting. These next three mind maps help you collect and organize your thoughts from each direction. Terminology: Start with a blank mind map, and create a map that organizes all the terms you can recall from this part, especially for Chapters 10 (design) and 11 (VLANs and trunking). After you have added all the terms you can recall, and organized which terms relate by connecting the terms into a hierarchy or other organization, go back to the Key Terms list at the end of each chapter. Add any terms you forgot to list in your map to this mind map. Commands: Create a mind map that focuses on remembering the config and EXEC com- mands related to VLANs and trunking. Do not be worried about every single parameter on each command; this exercise is more about remembering the commands available to you for each feature. Once you do what you can from memory, go back and check your map against the Chapter 11 Command Reference tables at the end of the chapter, and add to your map. Troubleshooting causes: Chapter 12 works through several issues that can cause prob- lems for interfaces, port security, and VLANs and VLAN trunks. Create one mind map with branches for each of these, from memory, with the usual goal of exercising your memory and building more connectors in your brain. Then skim the chapter and add to your map. Labs Depending on your chosen lab tool, here are some suggestions for what to do in lab: Pearson Network Simulator: If you use the full Pearson ICND1 or CCNA simulator, focus more on the configuration scenario and troubleshooting scenario labs associated with the topics in this part of the book. These types of labs include a larger set of topics, and work well as Part Review activities. (See the Introduction for some details about how to find which labs are about topics in this part of the book.) Config Labs: In your idle moments, review and repeat any of the Config Labs for this book part in the author’s blog; launch from blog.certskills.com/ccent and navigate to the Hands-on Config labs. Other: If using other lab tools, as a few suggestions: make sure and experiment heavily with VLAN configuration and VLAN trunking configuration. Also, experiment with the combinations of port security settings detailed in Chapter 12, focusing on the output from the show port-security command. Finally, spend some time changing interface set- tings like speed and duplex on a link between two switches, to make sure that you under- stand which cases would result in a duplex mismatch. The book makes a big transition at this point. Part I gave you a broad introduction to net- working, and Parts II and III went into some detail about the dominant LAN technology today: Ethernet. Part IV transitions from Ethernet to the network layer details that sit above Ethernet and WAN technology, specifically IPv4. In fact, the next four parts of the book discuss IPv4-specific features, as shown in Figure P4-1. Figure P4-1 Roadmap of Book Parts So Far Ethernet addressing, although important, did not require planning. The network engineer needs to understand MAC addresses, but MAC already exists on each Ethernet NIC, and switches learn the Ethernet MAC addresses dynamically without even needing to be con- figured to do so. Conversely, IP addressing requires planning, along with a much deeper understanding of the internal structure of the addresses. As a result, this book breaks down the addressing details into six separate chapters, spread across Parts IV and VI. Part IV examines most of the basic details of IPv4 addressing and subnet ting, mostly from the perspective of operating an IP network. Chapter 13 takes a grand tour of IPv4 address- ing as implemented inside a typical enterprise network. Chapters 14, 15, and 16 look at some of the specific questions people must ask themselves when operating an IPv4 network. Note that Part VI also discusses other details related to IPv4 addressing, with those chapters taking more of a design approach to IP addressing.

The CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams assess your readiness to use preexisting IP addressing and subnetting infor- mation to perform typical operations tasks, like monitoring the network, reacting to pos- sible problems, and troubleshooting those problems. However, you also need to understand how networks are designed and why. The thought processes used when monitoring any network continually ask the question, “Is the network working as designed?” If a problem exists, you must consider questions such as, “What happens when the network works normally, and what is different right now?” Both ques- tions require you to understand the intended design of the network, including details of the IP addressing and subnetting design. This chapter provides some perspectives and answers for the bigger issues in IPv4 address- ing. What addresses can be used so that they work properly? What addresses should be used? When told to use certain numbers, what does that tell you about the choices made by some other network engineer? How do these choices impact the practical job of configuring switches, routers, hosts, and operating the network on a daily basis? This chapter hopes to answer these questions while revealing details of how IPv4 addresses work. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter. The answers are at the bottom of the page following the quiz, and the explanations are in DVD Appendix C and in the PCPT software.

Foundation Topics Introduction to Subnetting Say you just happened to be at the sandwich shop when they were selling the world’s lon- gest sandwich. You’re pretty hungry, so you go for it. Now you have one sandwich, but at over 2 kilometers long, you realize it’s a bit more than you need for lunch all by yourself. To make the sandwich more useful (and more portable), you chop the sandwich into meal- size pieces, and give the pieces to other folks around you, who are also ready for lunch. Huh? Well, subnetting, at least the main concept, is similar to this sandwich story. You start with one network, but it is just one large network. As a single large entity, it might not be useful, and it is probably far too large. To make it useful, you chop it into smaller pieces, called subnets, and assign those subnets to be used in different parts of the enter- prise internetwork. This short section introduces IP subnetting. First, it shows the general ideas behind a com- pleted subnet design that indeed chops (or subnets) one network into subnets. The rest of this section describes the many design steps that you would take to create just such a subnet design. By the end of this section, you should have the right context to then read through the subnetting design steps introduced throughout the rest of this chapter . NOTE This chapter, and in fact the rest of the chapters in this book up until Chapter 28, “Fundamentals of IP Version 6,” focuses on IPv4 rather than IPv6. All references to IP refer to IPv4 unless otherwise stated. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 305 13 Subnetting Defined Through a Simple Example An IP network—in other words, a Class A, B, or C network—is simply a set of consecutively numbered IP addresses that follows some preset rules. These Class A, B, and C rules, first introduced back in section, “Class A, B, and C IP Networks,” of Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing,” define that for a given network, all the addresses in the network have the same value in some of the octets of the addresses. For example, Class B network 172.16.0.0 consists of all IP addresses that begin with 172.16: 172.16.0.0, 172.16.0.1, 172.16.0.2, and so on, through 172.16.255.255. Another example: Class A network 10.0.0.0 includes all addresses that begin with 10. An IP subnet is simply a subset of a Class A, B, or C network. If fact, the word subnet is a shortened version of the phrase subdivided network. For example, one subnet of Class B network 172.16.0.0 could be the set of all IP addresses that begin with 172.16.1, and would include 172.16.1.0, 172.16.1.1, 172.16.1.2, and so on, up through 172.16.1.255. Another subnet of that same Class B network could be all addresses that begin with 172.16.2. To give you a general idea, Figure 13-1 shows some basic documentation from a completed subnet design that could be used when an engineer subnets Class B network 172.16.0.0. EoMPLS R1 R2 R3 172.16.2.___ 172.16.3.___ 172.16.5.___ 172.16.1.___ Class B 172.16.0.0 First 3 Octets are Equal Subnet Design: 172.16.4.___ Figure 13-1 Subnet Plan Document The design shows five subnets: one for each of the three LANs and one each for the two WAN links. The small text note shows the rationale used by the engineer for the subnets: Each subnet includes addresses that have the same value in the first three octets. For exam- ple, for the LAN on the left, the number shows 172.16.1.__, meaning “all addresses that begin with 172.16.1.” Also, note that the design, as shown, does not use all the addresses in Class B network 172.16.0.0, so the engineer has left plenty of room for growth.

That is, someone else, before you got the job, designed how IP addressing and subnetting would work for that particular enterprise network. You need to interpret what someone else has already chosen. To fully understand IP addressing and subnetting, you need to think about subnetting from both a design and operational perspective. For example, Figure 13-1 simply states that in all these subnets, the first three octets must be equal. Why was that convention chosen? What alternatives exist? Would those alternatives be better for your internetwork today? All these questions relate more to subnetting design rather than to operation. To help you see both perspectives, some chapters in this part of the book focus more on design issues, while others focus more on operations by interpreting some existing design. This current chapter happens to move through the entire design process for the purpose of introducing the bigger picture of IP subnetting. Following this chapter, the next three chapters each take one topic from this chapter and examine it more closely, either from an operational or design perspective. The remaining three main sections of this chapter examine each of the steps listed in Figure 13-2, in sequence . Plan Implementation • Subnets Locations • Static IP • DHCP Ranges Design Subnets • Choose Network • Choose 1 Mask • List All Subnets Analyze Needs • # Subnets • # Hosts/Subnet • 1 Size Subnet Figure 13-2 Subnet Planning, Design, and Implementation Tasks Analyze Subnetting and Addressing Needs This section discusses the meaning of four basic questions that can be used to analyze the addressing and subnetting needs for any new or changing enterprise network: 1. Which hosts should be grouped together into a subnet? 2. How many subnets does this network require? 3. How many host IP addresses does each subnet require? 4. Will we use a single subnet size for simplicity, or not? Rules About Which Hosts Are in Which Subnet Every device that connects to an IP internetwork needs to have an IP address. These devices include computers used by end users, servers, mobile phones, laptops, IP phones, tablets, and networking devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. In short, any device that uses IP to send and receive packets needs an IP address. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 307 13 NOTE When discussing IP addressing, the term network has specific meaning: a Class A, B, or C IP network. To avoid confusion with that use of the term network, this book uses the terms internetwork and enterprise network when referring to a collection of hosts, routers, switches, and so on. The IP addresses must be assigned according to some basic rules, and for good reasons. To make routing work efficiently, IP addressing rules group addresses into groups called sub- nets. The rules are as follows: ■ Addresses in the same subnet are not separated by a router. ■ Addresses in different subnets are separated by at least one router. Figure 13-3 shows the general concept, with hosts A and B in one subnet and host C in another. In particular, note that hosts A and B are not separated from each other by any routers. However, host C, separated from A and B by at least one router, must be in a dif- ferent subnet. A Second Subnet One Subnet A Third Subnet R1 R2 A B C Figure 13-3 PC A and B in One Subnet, and PC C in a Different Subnet The idea that hosts on the same link must be in the same subnet is much like the postal code concept. All mailing addresses in the same town use the same postal code (ZIP codes in the United States). Addresses in another town, whether relatively nearby or on the other side of the country, have a different postal code. The postal code gives the postal service a better ability to automatically sort the mail to deliver it to the right location. For the same general reasons, hosts on the same LAN are in the same subnet, and hosts in different LANs are in different subnets. Note that the point-to-point WAN link in the figure also needs a subnet. Figure 13-3 shows Router R1 connected to the LAN subnet on the left and to a WAN subnet on the right. Router R2 connects to that same WAN subnet. To do so, both R1 and R2 will have IP addresses on their WAN interfaces, and the addresses will be in the same subnet. (An Ethernet over MPLS [EoMPLS] WAN link has the same IP addressing needs, with each of the two routers having an IP address in the same subnet.) The Ethernet LANs in Figure 13-3 also show a slightly different style of drawing, using simple lines with no Ethernet switch. Drawings of Ethernet LANs when the details of the LAN switches do not matter simply show each device connected to the same line, as shown in Figure 13-3. (This kind of drawing mimics the original Ethernet cabling before switches and hubs existed.) 308 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Finally, because the routers’ main job is to forward packets from one subnet to another, routers typically connect to multiple subnets. For example, in this case, Router R1 connects to one LAN subnet on the left and one WAN subnet on the right. To do so, R1 will be con- figured with two different IP addresses, one per interface. These addresses will be in differ- ent subnets, because the interfaces connect the router to different subnets. Determining the Number of Subnets To determine the number of subnets required, the engineer must think about the internet- work as documented and count the locations that need a subnet. To do so, the engineer requires access to network diagrams, VLAN configuration details, and details about WAN links. For the types of links discussed in this book, you should plan for one subnet for every ■ VLAN ■ Point-to-point serial link ■ Ethernet emulation WAN link (EoMPLS) NOTE WAN technologies like MPLS allow subnetting options other than one subnet per pair of routers on the WAN, but this book only uses WAN technologies that have one sub- net for each point-to-point WAN connection between two routers. For example, imagine that the network planner has only Figure 13-4 on which to base the subnet design. B1 B3 B2Core Figure 13-4 Four-Site Internetwork with Small Central Site The number of subnets required cannot be fully predicted with only this figure. Certainly, three subnets will be needed for the WAN links, one per link. However, each LAN switch can be configured with a single VLAN, or with multiple VLANs. You can be certain that you need at least one subnet for the LAN at each site, but you might need more. Next, consider the more detailed version of the same figure shown in Figure 13-5. In this case, the figure shows VLAN counts in addition to the same Layer 3 topology (the routers and the links connected to the routers). It also shows that the central site has many more switches, but the key fact on the left, regardless of how many switches exist, is that the central site has a total of 12 VLANs. Similarly, the figure lists each branch as having two VLANs. Along with the same three WAN subnets, this internetwork requires 21 subnets. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 309 13 2 VLANs 2 VLANs 2 VLANs 12 VLANs Legend: - Subnet B1 B3 B2Core Figure 13-5 Four-Site Internetwork with Larger Central Site Finally, in a real job, you would consider the needs today as well as how much growth you expect in the internetwork over time. Any subnetting plan should include a reasonable esti- mate of the number of subnets you need to meet future needs. Determining the Number of Hosts per Subnet Determining the number of hosts per subnet requires knowing a few simple concepts and then doing a lot of research and questioning. Every device that connects to a subnet needs an IP address. For a totally new network, you can look at business plans—numbers of people at the site, devices on order, and so on—to get some idea of the possible devices. When expanding an existing network to add new sites, you can use existing sites as a point of comparison, and then find out which sites will get bigger or smaller. And don’t forget to count the router interface IP address in each subnet and the switch IP address used to remotely manage the switch. Instead of gathering data for each and every site, planners often just use a few typical sites for planning purposes. For example, maybe you have some large sales offices and some small sales offices. You might dig in and learn a lot about only one large sales office and only one small sales office. Add that analysis to the fact that point-to-point links need a subnet with just two addresses, plus any analysis of more one-of-a-kind subnets, and you have enough information to plan the addressing and subnetting design. For example, in Figure 13-6, the engineer has built a diagram that shows the number of hosts per LAN subnet in the largest branch, B1. For the two other branches, the engineer did not bother to dig to find out the number of required hosts. As long as the number of required IP addresses at sites B2 and B3 stays below the estimate of 50, based on larger site B1, the engineer can plan for 50 hosts in each branch LAN subnet and have plenty of addresses per subnet. 310 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Largest: 50 Hosts/Subnet Smaller Smaller B1 B3 B2Core Figure 13-6 Large Branch B1 with 50 Hosts/Subnet One Size Subnet Fits All—Or Not The final choice in the initial planning step is to decide whether you will use a simpler design by using a one-size-subnet-fits-all philosophy. A subnet’s size, or length, is simply the number of usable IP addresses in the subnet. A subnetting design can either use one size subnet, or varied sizes of subnets, with pros and cons for each choice. Defining the Size of a Subnet Before you finish this book, you will learn all the details of how to determine the size of the subnet. For now, you just need to know a few specific facts about the size of sub- nets. Chapter 14, “Analyzing Classful IPv4 Networks,” and Chapter 15, “Analyzing Subnet Masks,” give you a progressively deeper knowledge of the details. The engineer assigns each subnet a subnet mask, and that mask, among other things, defines the size of that subnet. The mask sets aside a number of host bits whose purpose is to num- ber different host IP addresses in that subnet. Because you can number 2x things with x bits, if the mask defines H host bits, the subnet contains 2H unique numeric values. However, the subnet’s size is not 2H. It’s 2H – 2, because two numbers in each subnet are reserved for other purposes. Each subnet reserves the numerically lowest value for the sub- net number and the numerically highest value as the subnet broadcast address. As a result, the number of usable IP addresses per subnet is 2H – 2. NOTE The terms subnet number, subnet ID, and subnet address all refer to the number that represents or identifies a subnet. Figure 13-7 shows the general concept behind the three-part structure of an IP address, focusing on the host part and the resulting subnet size. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 311 13 Network Subnet Host 32 Bits H 2H - 2 Figure 13-7 Subnet Size Concepts One-Size Subnet Fits All To choose to use a single-size subnet in an enterprise network, you must use the same mask for all subnets, because the mask defines the size of the subnet. But which mask? One requirement to consider when choosing that one mask is this: That one mask must pro- vide enough host IP addresses to support the largest subnet. To do so, the number of host bits (H) defined by the mask must be large enough so that 2H – 2 is larger than (or equal to) the number of host IP addresses required in the largest subnet. For example, consider Figure 13-8. It shows the required number of hosts per LAN subnet. (The figure ignores the subnets on the WAN links, which require only two IP addresses each.) The branch LAN subnets require only 50 host addresses, but the main site LAN sub- net requires 200 host addresses. To accommodate the largest subnet, you need at least 8 host bits. Seven host bits would not be enough, because 27 – 2 = 126. Eight host bits would be enough, because 28 – 2 = 254, which is more than enough to support 200 hosts in a subnet. Need: 200 Addresses Need: 50 Addresses Each 254 254 254254 B1 B3 B2Core Figure 13-8 Network Using One Subnet Size What’s the big advantage when using a single-size subnet? Operational simplicity. In other words, keeping it simple. Everyone on the IT staff who has to work with networking can get used to working with one mask—and one mask only. They will be able to answer all subnet- ting questions more easily, because everyone gets used to doing subnetting math with that one mask. 312 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The big disadvantage for using a single-size subnet is that it wastes IP addresses. For exam- ple, in Figure 13-8, all the branch LAN subnets support 254 addresses, while the largest branch subnet needs only 50 addresses. The WAN subnets only need two IP addresses, but each supports 254 addresses, again wasting more IP addresses. The wasted IP addresses do not actually cause a problem in most cases, however. Most organizations use private IP networks in their enterprise internetworks, and a single Class A or Class B private network can supply plenty of IP addresses, even with the waste. Multiple Subnet Sizes (Variable-Length Subnet Masks) To create multiple sizes of subnets in one Class A, B, or C network, the engineer must cre- ate some subnets using one mask, some with another, and so on. Different masks mean dif- ferent numbers of host bits, and a different number of hosts in some subnets based on the 2H – 2 formula. For example, consider the requirements listed earlier in Figure 13-8. It showed one LAN subnet on the left that needs 200 host addresses, three branch subnets that need 50 address- es, and three WAN links that need two addresses. To meet those needs, but waste fewer IP addresses, three subnet masks could be used, creating subnets of three different sizes, as shown in Figure 13-9. 254 Need: 200 Need: 50 Each 62 62 62 2 2 2 B1 B3 B2Core Figure 13-9 Three Masks, Three Subnet Sizes The smaller subnets now waste fewer IP addresses compared to the design shown earlier in Figure 13-8. The subnets on the right that need 50 IP addresses have subnets with 6 host bits, for 26 – 2 = 62 available addresses per subnet. The WAN links use masks with 2 host bits, for 22 – 2 = 2 available addresses per subnet. However, some are still wasted, because you cannot set the size of the subnet as some arbi- trary size. All subnets will be a size based on the 2H – 2 formula, with H being the number of host bits defined by the mask for each subnet. This Book: One-Size Subnet Fits All (Mostly) For the most part, this book explains subnetting using designs that use a single mask, creat- ing a single subnet size for all subnets. Why? First, it makes the process of learning subnet- ting easier. Second, some types of analysis that you can do about a network—specifically, calculating the number of subnets in the classful network—only make sense when a single mask is used. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 313 13 However, you still need to be ready to work with variable-length subnet masks (VLSM), which is the practice of using different masks for different subnets in the same classful IP network. All of Chapter 22, “Variable-Length Subnet Masks,” focuses on VLSM. However, all the examples and discussion up until that chapter purposefully avoid VLSM just to keep the discussion simpler, for the sake of learning to walk before you run. Make Design Choices Now that you know how to analyze the IP addressing and subnetting needs, the next major step examines how to apply the rules of IP addressing and subnetting to those needs and make some choices. In other words, now that you know how many subnets you need and how many host addresses you need in the largest subnet, how do you create a useful sub- netting design that meets those requirements? The short answer is that you need to do the three tasks shown on the right side of Figure 13-10. Design Subnets • Choose Network • Choose 1 Mask • List All Subnets Analyze Needs # Subnets # Hosts/Subnet 1 Size Subnet Figure 13-10 Input to the Design Phase, and Design Questions to Answer Choose a Classful Network In the original design for what we know of today as the Internet, companies used registered public classful IP networks when implementing TCP/IP inside the company. By the mid- 1990s, an alternative became more popular: private IP networks. This section discusses the background behind these two choices, because it impacts the choice of what IP network a company will then subnet and implement in its enterprise internetwork. Public IP Networks The original design of the Internet required that any company that connected to the Internet had to use a registered public IP network. To do so, the company would complete some paperwork, describing the enterprise’s internetwork and the number of hosts exist- ing, plus plans for growth. After submitting the paperwork, the company would receive an assignment of either a Class A, B, or C network. Public IP networks, and the administrative processes surrounding them, ensure that all the companies that connect to the Internet all use unique IP addresses. In particular, after a pub- lic IP network is assigned to a company, only that company should use the addresses in that network. That guarantee of uniqueness means that Internet routing can work well, because there are no duplicate public IP addresses. For example, consider the example shown in Figure 13-11. Company 1 has been assigned public Class A network 1.0.0.0, and company 2 has been assigned public Class A network 2.0.0.0. Per the original intent for public addressing in the Internet, after these public net- work assignments have been made, no other companies can use addresses in Class A net- works 1.0.0.0 or 2.0.0.0. 314 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Internet Company 1 Company 2 1.0.0.0 2.0.0.0 Figure 13-11 Two Companies with Unique Public IP Networks This original address assignment process ensured unique IP addresses across the entire plan- et. The idea is much like the fact that your telephone number should be unique in the uni- verse, your postal mailing address should also be unique, and your email address should also be unique. If someone calls you, your phone rings, but no one else’s phone rings. Similarly, if company 1 is assigned Class A network 1.0.0.0, and it assigns address 1.1.1.1 to a particu- lar PC, that address should be unique in the universe. A packet sent through the Internet to destination 1.1.1.1 should only arrive at this one PC inside company 1, instead of being delivered to some other host. Growth Exhausts the Public IP Address Space By the early 1990s, the world was running out of public IP networks that could be assigned. During most of the 1990s, the number of hosts newly connected to the Internet was grow- ing at a double-digit pace, per month. Companies kept following the rules, asking for public IP networks, and it was clear that the current address-assignment scheme could not continue without some changes. Simply put, the number of Class A, B, and C networks supported by the 32-bit address in IP version 4 (IPv4) was not enough to support one public classful net- work per organization, while also providing enough IP addresses in each company. NOTE The universe has run out of public IPv4 addresses in a couple of significant ways. IANA, which assigns public IPv4 address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR) around the globe, assigned the last of the IPv4 address space in early 2011. By 2015, ARIN, the RIR for North America, exhausted its supply of IPv4 addresses, so that compa- nies must return unused public IPv4 addresses to ARIN before they have more to assign to new companies. Try an online search for “ARIN depletion” to see pages about the current status of available IPv4 address space for just one RIR example. The Internet community worked hard during the 1990s to solve this problem, coming up with several solutions, including the following: ■ A new version of IP (IPv6), with much larger addresses (128 bit) ■ Assigning a subset of a public IP network to each company, instead of an entire public IP network, to reduce waste ■ Network Address Translation (NAT), which allows the use of private IP networks These three solutions matter to real networks today. However, to stay focused on the topic of subnet design, this chapter focuses on the third option, and in particular, the private IP networks that can be used by an enterprise when also using NAT. Be aware that Part VIII gives more detail about the first bullet point, and Appendix N, “Classless Inter-Domain Routing,” discusses the middle bullet in the list, and is optional reading for anyone inter- ested in the topic. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 315 13 Focusing on the third item in the bullet list, NAT (as detailed in Chapter 27, “Network Address Translation”) allows multiple companies to use the exact same private IP network, using the same IP addresses as other companies while still connecting to the Internet. For example, Figure 13-12 shows the same two companies connecting to the Internet as in Figure 13-11, but now with both using the same private Class A network 10.0.0.0. Internet Company 1 Company 2 10.0.0.0 10.0.0.0 NAT NAT Figure 13-12 Reusing the Same Private Network 10.0.0.0 with NAT Both companies use the same classful IP network (10.0.0.0). Both companies can implement their subnet design internal to their respective enterprise internetworks, without discussing their plans. The two companies can even use the exact same IP addresses inside network 10.0.0.0. And amazingly, at the same time, both companies can even communicate with each other through the Internet. The technology called Network Address Translation makes it possible for companies to reuse the same IP networks, as shown in Figure 13-12. NAT does this by translating the IP addresses inside the packets as they go from the enterprise to the Internet, using a small number of public IP addresses to support tens of thousands of private IP addresses. That one bit of information is not enough to understand how NAT works; however, to keep the focus on subnetting, the book defers the discussion of how NAT works until Chapter 27. For now, accept that most companies use NAT, and therefore, they can use private IP net- works for their internetworks. Private IP Networks Request For Comments (RFC) 1918 defines the set of private IP networks, as listed in Table 13-2. By definition, these private IP networks ■ Will never be assigned to an organization as a public IP network ■ Can be used by organizations that will use NAT when sending packets into the Internet ■ Can also be used by organizations that never need to send packets into the Internet So, when using NAT—and almost every organization that connects to the Internet uses NAT—the company can simply pick one or more of the private IP networks from the list of reserved private IP network numbers. RFC 1918 defines the list, which is summarized in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 RFC 1918 Private Address Space Class of Networks Private IP Networks Number of Networks A 10.0.0.0 1 B 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0 16 C 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0 256 316 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide NOTE According to an informal survey I ran on my blog a few years back, about half of the respondents said that their networks use private Class A network 10.0.0.0, as opposed to other private networks or public networks. Choosing an IP Network During the Design Phase Today, some organizations use private IP networks along with NAT, and some use public IP networks. Most new enterprise internetworks use private IP addresses throughout the net- work, along with NAT, as part of the connection to the Internet. Those organizations that already have registered public IP networks—often obtained before the addresses started running short in the early 1990s—can continue to use those public addresses throughout their enterprise networks. After the choice to use a private IP network has been made, just pick one that has enough IP addresses. You can have a small internetwork and still choose to use private Class A net- work 10.0.0.0. It might seem wasteful to choose a Class A network that has over 16 million IP addresses, especially if you only need a few hundred. However, there’s no penalty or problem with using a private network that is too large for your current or future needs. For the purposes of this book, most examples use private IP network numbers. For the design step to choose a network number, just choose a private Class A, B, or C network from the list of RFC 1918 private networks. Regardless, from a math and concept perspective, the methods to subnet a public IP net- work versus a private IP network are the same. Choose the Mask If a design engineer followed the topics in this chapter so far, in order, he would know the following: ■ The number of subnets required ■ The number of hosts/subnet required ■ That a choice was made to use only one mask for all subnets, so that all subnets are the same size (same number of hosts/subnet) ■ The classful IP network number that will be subnetted This section completes the design process, at least the parts described in this chapter, by discussing how to choose that one mask to use for all subnets. First, this section examines default masks, used when a network is not subnetted, as a point of comparison. Next, the concept of borrowing host bits to create subnet bits is explored. Finally, this section ends with an example of how to create a subnet mask based on the analysis of the requirements. Classful IP Networks Before Subnetting Before an engineer subnets a classful network, the network is a single group of addresses. In other words, the engineer has not yet subdivided the network into many smaller subsets called subnets. When thinking about an unsubnetted classful network, the addresses in a network have only two parts: the network part and host part. Comparing any two addresses in the classful network: Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 317 13 ■ The addresses have the same value in the network part. ■ The addresses have different values in the host part. The actual sizes of the network and host part of the addresses in a network can be easily predicted, as shown in Figure 13-13. N=8 H=24 N=16 H=16 N=24 H=8 A B C Figure 13-13 Format of Unsubnetted Class A, B, and C Networks In Figure 13-13, N and H represent the number of network and host bits, respectively. Class rules define the number of network octets (1, 2, or 3) for Classes A, B, and C, respectively; the figure shows these values as a number of bits. The number of host octets is 3, 2, or 1, respectively. Continuing the analysis of classful network before subnetting, the number of addresses in one classful IP network can be calculated with the same 2H – 2 formula previously dis- cussed. In particular, the size of an unsubnetted Class A, B, or C network is as follows: ■ Class A: 224 – 2 = 16,777,214 ■ Class B: 216 – 2 = 65,534 ■ Class C: 28 – 2 = 254 Borrowing Host Bits to Create Subnet Bits To subnet a network, the designer thinks about the network and host parts, as shown in Figure 13-13, and then the engineer adds a third part in the middle: the subnet part. However, the designer cannot change the size of the network part or the size of the entire address (32 bits). To create a subnet part of the address structure, the engineer borrows bits from the host part. Figure 13-14 shows the general idea. N=8 S=__ H=__ N=16 N=24 S=__ H=__ S=__ H=__ A B C N + S + H = 32 A B C Figure 13-14 Concept of Borrowing Host Bits 318 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Figure 13-14 shows a rectangle that represents the subnet mask. N, representing the number of network bits, remains locked at 8, 16, or 24, depending on the class. Conceptually, the designer moves a (dashed) dividing line into the host field, with subnet bits (S) between the network and host parts, and the remaining host bits (H) on the right. The three parts must add up to 32, because IPv4 addresses consist of 32 bits. Choosing Enough Subnet and Host Bits The design process requires a choice of where to place the dashed line shown in Figure 13-14. But what is the right choice? How many subnet and host bits should the designer choose? The answers hinge on the requirements gathered in the early stages of the planning process: ■ Number of subnets required ■ Number of hosts/subnet The bits in the subnet part create a way to uniquely number the different subnets that the design engineer wants to create. With 1 subnet bit, you can number 21 or 2 subnets. With 2 bits, 22 or 4 subnets, with 3 bits, 23 or 8 subnets, and so on. The number of subnet bits must be large enough to uniquely number all the subnets, as determined during the planning process. At the same time, the remaining number of host bits must also be large enough to number the host IP addresses in the largest subnet. Remember, in this chapter, we assume the use of a single mask for all subnets. This single mask must support both the required number of subnets and the required number of hosts in the largest subnet. Figure 13-15 shows the concept. N S H Need Y Hosts/Subnet: 2H�����<\" Need X Subnets: 2S ��;\" Figure 13-15 Borrowing Enough Subnet and Host Bits Figure 13-15 shows the idea of the designer choosing a number of subnet (S) and host (H) bits and then checking the math. 2S must be more than the number of required subnets, or the mask will not supply enough subnets in this IP network. Also, 2H – 2 must be more than the required number of hosts/subnet. NOTE The idea of calculating the number of subnets as 2S applies only in cases where a single mask is used for all subnets of a single classful network, as is being assumed in this chapter. To effectively design masks, or to interpret masks that were chosen by someone else, you need a good working memory of the powers of 2. Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” lists a table with powers of 2 up through 232 for your reference. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 319 13 Example Design: 172.16.0.0, 200 Subnets, 200 Hosts To help make sense of the theoretical discussion so far, consider an example that focuses on the design choice for the subnet mask. In this case, the planning and design choices so far tell us the following: ■ Use a single mask for all subnets. ■ Plan for 200 subnets. ■ Plan for 200 host IP addresses per subnet. ■ Use private Class B network 172.16.0.0. To choose the mask, the designer asks this question: How many subnet (S) bits do I need to number 200 subnets? From Table 13-3, you can see that S = 7 is not large enough (27 = 128), but S = 8 is enough (28 = 256). So, you need at least 8 subnet bits. Next, the designer asks a similar question, based on the number of hosts per subnet: How many host (H) bits do I need to number 200 hosts per subnet? The math is basically the same, but the formula subtracts 2 when counting the number of hosts/subnet. From Table 13-3, you can see that H = 7 is not large enough (27 – 2 = 126), but H = 8 is enough (28 – 2 = 254). Only one possible mask meets all the requirements in this case. First, the number of net- work bits (N) must be 16, because the design uses a Class B network. The requirements tell us that the mask needs at least 8 subnet bits, and at least 8 host bits. The mask only has 32 bits in it; Figure 13-16 shows the resulting mask. N = 16 S = 8 H = 8 Excess: 56 2S Subnets Need: 200 256 2 H - 2 Need: 200 Hosts/Subnet 254 Excess: 54 B Figure 13-16 Example Mask Choice, N = 16, S = 8, H = 8 Masks and Mask Formats Although engineers think about IP addresses in three parts when making design choices (network, subnet, and host), the subnet mask gives the engineer a way to communicate those design choices to all the devices in the subnet. 320 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The subnet mask is a 32-bit binary number with a number of binary 1s on the left and with binary 0s on the right. By definition, the number of binary 0s equals the number of host bits; in fact, that is exactly how the mask communicates the idea of the size of the host part of the addresses in a subnet. The beginning bits in the mask equal binary 1, with those bit posi- tions representing the combined network and subnet parts of the addresses in the subnet. Because the network part always comes first, then the subnet part, and then the host part, the subnet mask, in binary form, cannot have interleaved 1s and 0s. Each subnet mask has one unbroken string of binary 1s on the left, with the rest of the bits as binary 0s. After the engineer chooses the classful network and the number of subnet and host bits in a subnet, creating the binary subnet mask is easy. Just write down N 1s, S 1s, and then H 0s (assuming that N, S, and H represent the number of network, subnet, and host bits). Figure 13-17 shows the mask based on the previous example, which subnets a Class B network by creating 8 subnet bits, leaving 8 host bits. 11111111 11111111 N = 16 S = 8 H = 8 11111111 00000000 Figure 13-17 Creating the Subnet Mask—Binary—Class B Network In addition to the binary mask shown in Figure 13-17, masks can also be written in two other formats: the familiar dotted-decimal notation (DDN) seen in IP addresses and an even briefer prefix notation. Chapter 15 discusses these formats and how to convert between the different formats. Build a List of All Subnets This final task of the subnet design step determines the actual subnets that can be used, based on all the earlier choices. The earlier design work determined the Class A, B, or C network to use, and the (one) subnet mask to use that supplies enough subnets and enough host IP addresses per subnet. But what are those subnets? How do you identify or describe a subnet? This section answers these questions. A subnet consists of a group of consecutive numbers. Most of these numbers can be used as IP addresses by hosts. However, each subnet reserves the first and last numbers in the group, and these two numbers cannot be used as IP addresses. In particular, each subnet contains the following : ■ Subnet number: Also called the subnet ID or subnet address, this number identifies the subnet. It is the numerically smallest number in the subnet. It cannot be used as an IP address by a host. ■ Subnet broadcast: Also called the subnet broadcast address or directed broadcast address, this is the last (numerically highest) number in the subnet. It also cannot be used as an IP address by a host. ■ IP addresses: All the numbers between the subnet ID and the subnet broadcast address can be used as a host IP address. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 321 13 For example, consider the earlier case in which the design results were as follows: Network 172.16.0.0 (Class B) Mask 255.255.255.0 (for all subnets) With some math, the facts about each subnet that exists in this Class B network can be cal- culated. In this case, Table 13-3 shows the first ten such subnets. It then skips many subnets and shows the last two (numerically largest) subnets. Table 13-3 First Ten Subnets, Plus the Last Few, from 172.16.0.0, 255.255.255.0 Subnet Number IP Addresses Broadcast Address 172.16.0.0 172.16.0.1 – 172.16.0.254 172.16.0.255 172.16.1.0 172.16.1.1 – 172.16.1.254 172.16.1.255 172.16.2.0 172.16.2.1 – 172.16.2.254 172.16.2.255 172.16.3.0 172.16.3.1 – 172.16.3.254 172.16.3.255 172.16.4.0 172.16.4.1 – 172.16.4.254 172.16.4.255 172.16.5.0 172.16.5.1 – 172.16.5.254 172.16.5.255 172.16.6.0 172.16.6.1 – 172.16.6.254 172.16.6.255 172.16.7.0 172.16.7.1 – 172.16.7.254 172.16.7.255 172.16.8.0 172.16.8.1 – 172.16.8.254 172.16.8.255 172.16.9.0 172.16.9.1 – 172.16.9.254 172.16.9.255 Skipping many… 172.16.254.0 172.16.254.1 – 172.16.254.254 172.16.254.255 172.16.255.0 172.16.255.1 – 172.16.255.254 172.16.255.255 After you have the network number and the mask, calculating the subnet IDs and other details for all subnets requires some math. In real life, most people use subnet calculators or subnet-planning tools. For the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams, you need to be ready to find this kind of information; in this book, Chapter 21, “Subnet Design,” shows you how to find all the subnets of a given network. Plan the Implementation The next step, planning the implementation, is the last step before actually configuring the devices to create a subnet. The engineer first needs to choose where to use each subnet. For example, at a branch office in a particular city, which subnet from the subnet planning chart (Table 13-3) should be used for each VLAN at that site? Also, for any interfaces that require static IP addresses, which addresses should be used in each case? Finally, what range of IP addresses from inside each subnet should be configured in the DHCP server, to be dynami- cally leased to hosts for use as their IP address? Figure 13-18 summarizes the list of imple- mentation planning tasks. 322 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Plan Implementation • Subnets Locations • Static IP • DHCP Ranges Analyze Needs # Subnets # Hosts/Subnet 1 Size Subnet Design Subnets Choose Network Choose 1 Mask List All Subnets Figure 13-18 Facts Supplied to the Plan Implementation Step Assigning Subnets to Different Locations The job is simple: Look at your network diagram, identify each location that needs a subnet, and pick one from the table you made of all the possible subnets. Then, track it so that you know which ones you use where, using a spreadsheet or some other purpose-built subnet- planning tool. That’s it! Figure 13-19 shows a sample of a completed design using Table 13-3, which happens to match the initial design sample shown way back in Figure 13-1. 172.16.2.0 /24 172.16.3.0 /24 172.16.5.0 /24 172.16.1.0 /24 172.16.4.0 /24 Class B 172.16.0.0 /24 (255.255.255.0) Subnet Design Choices: R2 R3 R1 Figure 13-19 Example of Subnets Assigned to Different Locations Although this design could have used any five subnets from Table 13-3, in real networks, engineers usually give more thought to some strategy for assigning subnets. For example, you might assign all LAN subnets lower numbers and WAN subnets higher numbers. Or you might slice off large ranges of subnets for different divisions of the company. Or you might follow that same strategy, but ignore organizational divisions in the company, paying more attention to geographies. For example, for a U.S.-based company with a smaller presence in both Europe and Asia, you might plan to reserve ranges of subnets based on continent. This kind of choice is par- ticularly useful when later trying to use a feature called route summarization. Chapter 13: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 323 13 NOTE Although not discussed in this book, DVD Appendix O, “Route Summarization,” provides content about route summarization from an earlier edition of this book, for those who are interested in further reading. Figure 13-20 shows the general benefit of placing addressing in the network for easier route summarization, using the same subnets from Table 13-3 again.

For DHCP to work, the network engineer must tell the DHCP server the subnets for which it must assign IP addresses. In addition, that configuration limits the DHCP server to only a subset of the addresses in the subnet. For static addresses, you simply configure the device to tell it what IP address and mask to use. To keep things as simple as possible, most shops use a strategy to separate the static IP addresses on one end of each subnet, and the DHCP-assigned dynamic addresses on the other. It does not really matter whether the static addresses sit on the low end of the range of addresses or the high end. For example, imagine that the engineer decides that, for the LAN subnets in Figure 13-19, the DHCP pool comes from the high end of the range, namely, addresses that end in .101 through .254. (The address that ends in .255 is, of course, reserved.) The engineer also assigns static addresses from the lower end, with addresses ending in .1 through .100. Figure 13-21 shows the idea . 324 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide .101 .102 172.16.2.___ .101 .102 172.16.3.___ 172.16.1.___ .1 .1 .1.11 Notes: 1 - 100 101 - 254 Static: DHCP: R2 R3 R1 Figure 13-21 Static from the Low End and DHCP from the High End Figure 13-21 shows all three routers with statically assigned IP addresses that end in .1. The only other static IP address in the figure is assigned to the server on the left, with address 172.16.1.11 (abbreviated simply as .11 in the figure). On the right, each LAN has two PCs that use DHCP to dynamically lease their IP addresses. DHCP servers often begin by leasing the addresses at the bottom of the range of addresses, so in each LAN, the hosts have leased addresses that end in .101 and .102, which are at the low end of the range chosen by design.

Based on the IP address alone, you should be able to determine several facts about the Class A, B, or C network in which the IP address resides. These facts can be useful when troubleshooting some networking problems. This chapter lists the key facts about classful IP networks and explains how to discover these facts. Following that, this chapter lists some practice problems. Before moving to the next chapter, you should practice until you can consistently determine all these facts, quick- ly and confidently, based on an IP address. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

As part of the interview, you’re given an IPv4 address and mask: 10.4.5.99, 255.255.255.0. What can you tell the inter- viewer about the classful network (in this case, the Class A network) in which the IP address resides? This section, the first of two major sections in this chapter, reviews the concepts of classful IP networks (in other words, Class A, B, and C networks). In particular, this chapter exam- ines how to begin with a single IP address and then determine the following facts: ■ Class (A, B, or C) ■ Default mask ■ Number of network octets/bits ■ Number of host octets/bits ■ Number of host addresses in the network ■ Network ID ■ Network broadcast address ■ First and last usable address in the network IPv4 Network Classes and Related Facts IP version 4 (IPv4) defines five address classes. Three of the classes, Classes A, B, and C, consist of unicast IP addresses. Unicast addresses identify a single host or interface so that the address uniquely identifies the device. Class D addresses serve as multicast addresses, so that one packet sent to a Class D multicast IPv4 address can actually be delivered to multi- ple hosts. Finally, Class E addresses were originally intended for experimentation, but were changed to simply be reserved for future use . The class can be identified based on the value of the first octet of the address, as shown in Table 14-2. Table 14-2 IPv4 Address Classes Based on First Octet Values Class First Octet Values Purpose A 1–126 Unicast (large networks) B 128–191 Unicast (medium-sized networks) C 192–223 Unicast (small networks) D 224–239 Multicast E 240–255 Reserved (formerly experimental) After you identify the class as either A, B, or C, many other related facts can be derived just through memorization. Table 14-3 lists that information for reference and later study; each of these concepts is described in this chapter.

The important fact to know is that Class A network 0.0.0.0 and network 127.0.0.0 are reserved. In fact, they have been reserved since the creation of Class A networks, as listed in RFC 791 (pub- lished in 1981). Although it may be a bit of a tangent, what is more interesting today is that over time, other newer RFCs have also reserved small pieces of the Class A, B, and C address space. So, tables like Table 14-3, with the count of the numbers of Class A, B, and C networks, are a good place to get a sense of the size of the number; however, the number of reserved networks does change slightly over time (albeit slowly) based on these other reserved address ranges. NOTE If you are interested in seeing all the reserved IPv4 address ranges, just do an Internet search on “IANA IPv4 special-purpose address registry.” The Number and Size of the Class A, B, and C Networks Table 14-3 lists the range of Class A, B, and C network numbers; however, some key points can be lost just referencing a table of information. This section examines the Class A, B, and C network numbers, focusing on the more important points and the exceptions and unusual cases. First, the number of networks from each class significantly differs. Only 126 Class A net- works exist: network 1.0.0.0, 2.0.0.0, 3.0.0.0, and so on, up through network 126.0.0.0. However, 16,384 Class B networks exist, with more than 2 million Class C networks. Next, note that the size of networks from each class also significantly differs. Each Class A network is relatively large—over 16 million host IP addresses per network—so they were originally intended to be used by the largest companies and organizations. Class B networks are smaller, with over 65,000 hosts per network. Finally, Class C networks, intended for small organizations, have 254 hosts in each network. Figure 14-1 summarizes those facts. 330 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Class Networks Hosts/Network A 126 16,777,214 B 16,384 65,534 C 2,097,152 254 Figure 14-1 Numbers and Sizes of Class A, B, and C Networks Address Formats In some cases, an engineer might need to think about a Class A, B, or C network as if the network has not been subdivided through the subnetting process. In such a case, the addresses in the classful network have a structure with two parts: the network part (some- times called the prefix ) and the host part . Then, comparing any two IP addresses in one network, the following observations can be made: The addresses in the same network have the same values in the network part. The addresses in the same network have different values in the host part. For example, in Class A network 10.0.0.0, by definition, the network part consists of the first octet. As a result, all addresses have an equal value in the network part, namely a 10 in the first octet. If you then compare any two addresses in the network, the addresses have a dif- ferent value in the last three octets (the host octets). For example, IP addresses 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2 have the same value (10) in the network part, but different values in the host part. Figure 14-2 shows the format and sizes (in number of bits) of the network and host parts of IP addresses in Class A, B, and C networks, before any subnetting has been applied. Network (8) Host (24)A Network (24) Host (8)C Network (16) Host (16)B Figure 14-2 Sizes (Bits) of the Network and Host Parts of Unsubnetted Classful Networks Chapter 14: Analyzing Classful IPv4 Networks 331 14 Default Masks Although we humans can easily understand the concepts behind Figure 14-2, computers prefer numbers. To communicate those same ideas to computers, each network class has an associated default mask that defines the size of the network and host parts of an unsub- netted Class A, B, and C network. To do so, the mask lists binary 1s for the bits considered to be in the network part and binary 0s for the bits considered to be in the host part. For example, Class A network 10.0.0.0 has a network part of the first single octet (8 bits) and a host part of last three octets (24 bits). As a result, the Class A default mask is 255.0.0.0, which in binary is 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 Figure 14-3 shows default masks for each network class, both in binary and dotted-decimal format.

Decimal 0, converted to 8-bit binary, is 00000000. See Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” for a conversion table. Number of Hosts per Network Calculating the number of hosts per network requires some basic binary math. First, consid- er a case where you have a single binary digit. How many unique values are there? There are, of course, two values: 0 and 1. With 2 bits, you can make four combinations: 00, 01, 10, and 11. As it turns out, the total combination of unique values you can make with N bits is 2N. Host addresses—the IP addresses assigned to hosts—must be unique. The host bits exist for the purpose of giving each host a unique IP address by virtue of having a different value in the host part of the addresses. So, with H host bits, 2H unique combinations exist. 332 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide However, the number of hosts in a network is not 2H; instead, it is 2H – 2. Each network reserves two numbers that would have otherwise been useful as host addresses, but have instead been reserved for special use: one for the network ID and one for the network broadcast address. As a result, the formula to calculate the number of host addresses per Class A, B, or C network is 2H – 2 where H is the number of host bits. Deriving the Network ID and Related Numbers Each classful network has four key numbers that describe the network. You can derive these four numbers if you start with just one IP address in the network. The numbers are as follows: ■ Network number ■ First (numerically lowest) usable address ■ Last (numerically highest) usable address ■ Network broadcast address First, consider both the network number and first usable IP address. The network number, also called the network ID or network address , identifies the network. By definition, the network number is the numerically lowest number in the network. However, to prevent any ambiguity, the people that made up IP addressing added the restriction that the network number cannot be assigned as an IP address. So, the lowest number in the network is the network ID. Then, the first (numerically lowest) host IP address is one larger than the net- work number. Next, consider the network broadcast address along with the last (numerically highest) usable IP address. The TCP/IP RFCs define a network broadcast address as a special address in each network. This broadcast address could be used as the destination address in a packet, and the routers would forward a copy of that one packet to all hosts in that classful network. Numerically, a network broadcast address is always the highest (last) number in the network. As a result, the highest (last) number usable as an IP address is the address that is simply one less than the network broadcast address. Simply put, if you can find the network number and network broadcast address, finding the first and last usable IP addresses in the network is easy. For the exam, you should be able to find all four values with ease; the process is as follows: Step 1. Determine the class (A, B, or C) based on the first octet. Step 2. Mentally divide the network and host octets based on the class. Step 3. To find the network number, change the IP address’s host octets to 0. Step 4. To find the first address, add 1 to the fourth octet of the network ID. Step 5. To find the broadcast address, change the network ID’s host octets to 255. Step 6. To find the last address, subtract 1 from the fourth octet of the network broadcast address. Chapter 14: Analyzing Classful IPv4 Networks 333 14 The written process actually looks harder than it is. Figure 14-4 shows an example of the process, using Class A IP address 10.17.18.21, with the circled numbers matching the process. CBAClass 1 Network Host 2Divide 3Make Host=0 10 . 0 . 0 . 0 10 . 0 . 0 . 14Add 1 10 . 17 . 18 . 21 5Make Host=255 10 . 255 . 255 . 255 6Subtract 1 10 . 255 . 255 . 254 +1 -1 Figure 14-4 Example of Deriving the Network ID and Other Values from 10.17.18.21 Figure 14-4 shows the identification of the class as Class A (Step 1) and the number of net- work/host octets as 1 and 3, respectively. So, to find the network ID at Step 3, the figure copies only the first octet, setting the last three (host) octets to 0. At Step 4, just copy the network ID and add 1 to the fourth octet. Similarly, to find the broadcast address at Step 5, copy the network octets, but set the host octets to 255. Then, at Step 6, subtract 1 from the fourth octet to find the last (numerically highest) usable IP address. Just to show an alternative example, consider IP address 172.16.8.9. Figure 14-5 shows the process applied to this IP address. CA BClass 1 Network Host 2Divide 3Make Host=0 172 . 16 . 0 . 0 172 . 16 . 0 . 14Add 1 172 . 16 . 8 . 9 5Make Host=255 172 . 16 . 255 . 255 6Subtract 1 172 . 16 . 255 . 254 +1 -1 Figure 14-5 Example Deriving the Network ID and Other Values from 172.16.8.9 Figure 14-5 shows the identification of the class as Class B (Step 1) and the number of net- work/host octets as 2 and 2, respectively. So, to find the network ID at Step 3, the figure copies only the first two octets, setting the last two (host) octets to 0. Similarly, Step 5 shows the same action, but with the last two (host) octets being set to 255. 334 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Unusual Network IDs and Network Broadcast Addresses Some of the more unusual numbers in and around the range of Class A, B, and C network numbers can cause some confusion. This section lists some examples of numbers that make many people make the wrong assumptions about the meaning of the number. For Class A, the first odd fact is that the range of values in the first octet omits the numbers 0 and 127. As it turns out, what would be Class A network 0.0.0.0 was originally reserved for some broadcasting requirements, so all addresses that begin with 0 in the first octet are reserved. What would be Class A network 127.0.0.0 is still reserved because of a special address used in software testing, called the loopback address (127.0.0.1). For Class B (and C), some of the network numbers can look odd, particularly if you fall into a habit of thinking that 0s at the end means the number is a network ID, and 255s at the end means it’s a network broadcast address. First, Class B network numbers range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0, for a total of 214 networks. However, even the very first (lowest number) Class B network number (128.0.0.0) looks a little like a Class A network number, because it ends with three 0s. However, the first octet is 128, making it a Class B network with a two- octet network part (128.0). For another Class B example, the high end of the Class B range also might look strange at first glance (191.255.0.0), but this is indeed the numerically highest of the valid Class B net- work numbers. This network’s broadcast address, 191.255.255.255, might look a little like a Class A broadcast address because of the three 255s at the end, but it is indeed the broad- cast address of a Class B network. Similarly to Class B networks, some of the valid Class C network numbers do look strange. For example, Class C network 192.0.0.0 looks a little like a Class A network because of the last three octets being 0, but because it is a Class C network, it consists of all addresses that begin with three octets equal to 192.0.0. Similarly, Class C network 223.255.255.0, another valid Class C network, consists of all addresses that begin with 223.255.255. Practice with Classful Networks As with all areas of IP addressing and subnetting, you need to practice to be ready for the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams. You should practice some while read- ing this chapter to make sure that you understand the processes. At that point, you can use your notes and this book as a reference, with a goal of understanding the process. After that, keep practicing this and all the other subnetting processes. Before you take the exam, you should be able to always get the right answer, and with speed. Table 14-4 summarizes the key concepts and suggestions for this two-phase approach.

If a value is between 1 and 126, inclusive, the address is a Class A address, with one network and three host octets. If a value is between 128 and 191 inclusive, the address is a Class B address, with two network and two host octets. If a value is between 192 and 223, inclusive, it is a Class C address, with three network octets and one host octet. The last two columns can be found based on Table 14-3, specifically the number of network and host octets along with the IP address. To find the network ID, copy the IP address, but change the host octets to 0. Similarly, to find the network broadcast address, copy the IP address, but change the host octets to 255. The last three problems can be confusing, and were included on purpose so that you could see an example of these unusual cases, as follows. 338 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Answers to Practice Problem 7 (from Table 14-5) Consider IP address 192.0.0.1. First, 192 is on the lower edge of the first octet range for Class C; as such, this address has three network and one host octet. To find the network ID, copy the address, but change the single host octet (the fourth octet) to 0, for a network ID of 192.0.0.0. It looks strange, but it is indeed the network ID. The network broadcast address choice for problem 7 can also look strange. To find the broadcast address, copy the IP address (192.0.0.1), but change the last octet (the only host octet) to 255, for a broadcast address of 192.0.0.255. In particular, if you decide that the broadcast should be 192.255.255.255, you might have fallen into the trap of logic, like “Change all 0s in the network ID to 255s,” which is not the correct logic. Instead, change all host octets in the IP address (or network ID) to 255s. Answers to Practice Problem 8 (from Table 14-5) The first octet of problem 8 (191.255.1.47) sits on the upper edge of the Class B range for the first octet (128–191). As such, to find the network ID, change the last two octets (host octets) to 0, for a network ID of 191.255.0.0. This value sometimes gives people problems, because they are used to thinking that 255 somehow means the number is a broadcast address. The broadcast address, found by changing the two host octets to 255, means that the broadcast address is 191.255.255.255. It looks more like a broadcast address for a Class A network, but it is actually the broadcast address for Class B network 191.255.0.0. Answers to Practice Problem 9 (from Table 14-5) Problem 9, with IP address 223.223.0.1, is near the high end of the Class C range. As a result, only the last (host) octet is changed to 0 to form the network ID 223.223.0.0. It looks a little like a Class B network number at first glance, because it ends in two octets of 0. However, it is indeed a Class C network ID (based on the value in the first octet).

First, the mask divides addresses into two parts: prefix and host, with the host part defining the size of the subnet. Then, the class (A, B, or C) further divides the structure of addresses in a subnet, breaking the prefix part into the network and subnet parts. The subnet part defines the number of subnets that could exist inside one classful IP network, assuming that one mask is used throughout the classful network. The subnet mask holds the key to understanding several important subnetting design points. However, to analyze a subnet mask, you first need some basic math skills with masks. The math converts masks between the three different formats used to represent a mask: ■ Binary ■ Dotted-decimal notation (DDN) ■ Prefix (also called classless interdomain routing [CIDR]) This chapter has two major sections. The first focuses totally on the mask formats and the math used to convert between the three formats. The second section explains how to take an IP address and its subnet mask and analyze those values. In particular, it shows how to determine the three-part format of the IPv4 address and describes the facts about the sub- netting design that are implied by the mask. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

You can then use these processes when you practice. If you already know how to convert from one format to the other, go ahead and move to the section “Practice Converting Subnet Masks,” later in this chapter. Three Mask Formats Subnet masks can be written as 32-bit binary numbers, but not just any binary number. In particular, the binary subnet mask must follow these rules: ■ The value must not interleave 1s and 0s. ■ If 1s exist, they are on the left. ■ If 0s exist, they are on the right. For example, the following values would be illegal. The first is illegal because the value interleaves 0s and 1s, and the second is illegal because it lists 0s on the left and 1s on the right: 10101010 01010101 11110000 00001111 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111 The following two binary values meet the requirements, in that they have all 1s on the left, followed by all 0s, with no interleaving of 1s and 0s: 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 Two alternative subnet mask formats exist so that we humans do not have to work with 32-bit binary numbers. One format, dotted-decimal notation (DDN) , converts each set of 8 Chapter 15: Analyzing Subnet Masks 343 15 bits into the decimal equivalent. For example, the two previous binary masks would convert to the following DDN subnet masks, because binary 11111111 converts to decimal 255, and binary 00000000 converts to decimal 0: 255.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 Although the DDN format has been around since the beginning of IPv4 addressing, the third mask format was added later, in the early 1990s: the prefix format. This format takes advantage of the rule that the subnet mask starts with some number of 1s, and then the rest of the digits are 0s. Prefix format lists a slash (/) followed by the number of binary 1s in the binary mask. Using the same two examples as earlier in this section, the prefix format equivalent masks are as follows: /8 /24 Note that although the terms prefix or prefix mask can be used, the terms CIDR mask or slash mask can also be used. This newer prefix style mask was created around the same time as the classless interdomain routing (CIDR) specification back in the early 1990s, and the acronym CIDR grew to be used for anything related to CIDR, including prefix-style masks. In addition, the term slash mask is sometimes used because the value includes a slash mark (/). You need to get comfortable working with masks in different formats. The rest of this sec- tion examines how to convert between the three formats. Converting Between Binary and Prefix Masks Converting between binary and prefix masks should be relatively intuitive after you know that the prefix value is simply the number of binary 1s in the binary mask. For the sake of completeness, the processes to convert in each direction are Binary to prefix: Count the number of binary 1s in the binary mask, and write the total, in decimal, after a /. Prefix to binary: Write P binary 1s, where P is the prefix value, followed by as many binary 0s as required to create a 32-bit number. Tables 15-2 and 15-3 show some examples.

Each decimal number represents 8 bits. So, a single DDN shows four decimal numbers that together represent some 32-bit binary number. Conversion from a DDN mask to the binary equivalent is relatively simple to describe, but can be laborious to perform. First, to do the conversion, the process is as follows: For each octet, perform a decimal-to-binary conversion. However, depending on your comfort level with doing decimal-to-binary conversions, that process can be difficult or time-consuming. If you want to think about masks in binary for the exam, consider picking one of the following methods to do the conversion and practic- ing until you can do it quickly and accurately: ■ Do the decimal-binary conversions, but practice your decimal-binary conversions to get fast. If you choose this path, consider the Cisco Binary Game , which you can find by searching its name at the Cisco Learning Network (CLN) (http://learningnetwork.cisco.com). ■ Use the decimal-binary conversion chart in Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables.” This lets you find the answer more quickly now, but you cannot use the chart on exam day. ■ Memorize the nine possible decimal values that can be in a decimal mask, and practice using a reference table with those values. The third method, which is the method recommended in this book, takes advantage of the fact that any and every DDN mask octet must be one of only nine values. Why? Well, remember how a binary mask cannot interleave 1s and 0s, and the 0s must be on the right? It turns out that only nine different 8-bit binary numbers conform to these rules. Table 15-4 lists the values, along with other relevant information.

Some of those pro- cesses—mask conversion included—use the information in Table 15-4. You should plan to memorize the information in the table. I recommend making a copy of the table to keep handy while you practice. (You will likely memorize the contents of this table simply by practicing the conversion process enough to get both good and fast at the conversion.) Using the table, the conversion processes in each direction with binary and decimal masks are as follows: Binary to decimal: Organize the bits into four sets of eight. For each octet, find the bi- nary value in the table and write down the corresponding decimal value. Decimal to binary: For each octet, find the decimal value in the table and write down the corresponding 8-bit binary value. Tables 15-5 and 15-6 show some examples.

For example, to move from decimal to prefix, first convert decimal to binary and then from binary to prefix. For the exams, set a goal to master these conversions doing the math in your head. While learning, you will likely want to use paper. To train yourself to do all this without writing it down, instead of writing each octet of binary, just write the number of binary 1s in that octet. Figure 15-1 shows an example with a prefix-to-decimal conversion. The left side shows the conversion to binary as an interim step. For comparison, the right side shows the binary inter- im step in shorthand that just lists the number of binary 1s in each octet of the binary mask. /18 11111111 11111111 11000000 00000000 255 . 255 192 0.. /18 8 8 2 0 255 . 255 192 0.. +++ Figure 15-1 Conversion from Prefix to Decimal: Full Binary Versus Shorthand Similarly, when converting from decimal to prefix, mentally convert to binary along the way, and as you improve, just think of the binary as the number of 1s in each octet. Figure 15-2 shows an example of such a conversion. 11111111 11111000 00000000 00000000 255 . 248 0 0.. /13 8 5 0 0 255 . 248 0 0.. +++ /13 Figure 15-2 Conversion from Decimal to Prefix: Full Binary Versus Shorthand Note that Appendix A has a table that lists all 33 legal subnet masks, with all three formats shown. Practice Converting Subnet Masks Before moving to the second half of this chapter, and thinking about what these subnet masks mean, first do some practice. Practice the processes discussed in this chapter until you get the right answer most of the time. Later, before taking the exam, practice more until you master the topics in this chapter and can move pretty fast, as outlined in the right column of Table 15-7.

In fact, if ten experienced network engineers were inde- pendently asked, “What is the purpose of a subnet mask?” the engineers would likely give a variety of true answers. The subnet mask plays several roles. This chapter focuses on one particular use of a subnet mask: defining the prefix part of the IP addresses in a subnet. The prefix part must be the same value for all addresses in a sub- net. In fact, a single subnet can be defined as all IPv4 addresses that have the same value in the prefix part of their IPv4 addresses. While the previous paragraph might sound a bit formal, the idea is relatively basic, as shown in Figure 15-3. The figure shows a network diagram, focusing on two subnets: a subnet of all addresses that begin with 172.16.2 and another subnet made of all addresses that begin with 172.16.3. In this example, the prefix—the part that has the same value in all the addresses in the subnet—is the first three octets. 348 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide 172.16.2.101 172.16.2.102 Subnet 172.16.2.0/24 172.16.3.101 172.16.3.102 Subnet 172.16.3.0/24 172.16.5.0/24 172.16.4.0/24172.16.1.0/24 R1 R2 R3 Figure 15-3 Simple Subnet Design, with Mask /24 While people can sit around a conference table and talk about how a prefix is three octets long, computers communicate that same concept using a subnet mask. In this case, the sub- nets use a subnet mask of /24, which means that the prefix part of the addresses is 24 bits (3 octets) long. This section explains more about how to use a subnet mask to understand this concept of a prefix part of an IPv4 address, along with these other uses for a subnet mask. Note that this section discusses the first five items in the list. ■ Defines the size of the prefix (combined network and subnet) part of the addresses in a subnet ■ Defines the size of the host part of the addresses in the subnet ■ Can be used to calculate the number of hosts in the subnet ■ Provides a means for the network designer to communicate the design details—the num- ber of subnet and host bits—to the devices in the network ■ Under certain assumptions, can be used to calculate the number of subnets in the entire classful network ■ Can be used in binary calculations of both the subnet ID and the subnet broadcast address Masks Divide the Subnet’s Addresses into Two Parts The subnet mask subdivides the IP addresses in a subnet into two parts: the prefix, or sub- net part, and the host part. The prefix part identifies the addresses that reside in the same subnet, because all IP addresses in the same subnet have the same value in the prefix part of their addresses. The idea is much like the postal code (ZIP codes in the United States) in mailing addresses. All mailing addresses in the same town have the same postal code. Likewise, all IP addresses in the same subnet have identical values in the prefix part of their addresses. The host part of an address identifies the host uniquely inside the subnet. If you compare any two IP addresses in the same subnet, their host parts will differ, even though the prefix parts of their addresses have the same value. To summarize these key comparisons: Chapter 15: Analyzing Subnet Masks 349 15 Prefix (subnet) part: Equal in all addresses in the same subnet. Host part: Different in all addresses in the same subnet. For example, imagine a subnet that, in concept, includes all addresses whose first three octets are 10.1.1. So, the following list shows several addresses in this subnet: 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.3 In this list, the prefix or subnet part (the first three octets of 10.1.1) are equal. The host part (the last octet [in bold]) is different. So, the prefix or subnet part of the address identifies the group, and the host part identifies the specific member of the group. The subnet mask defines the dividing line between the prefix and the host part. To do so, the mask creates a conceptual line between the binary 1s in the binary mask and the binary 0s in the mask. In short, if a mask has P binary 1s, the prefix part is P bits long and the rest of the bits are host bits. Figure 15-4 shows the general concept. Prefix (P) Host (H) 32 Bits Mask 0sMask 1s Figure 15-4 Prefix (Subnet) and Host Parts Defined by Masks 1s and 0s The next figure, Figure 15-5, shows a specific example using mask 255.255.255.0. Mask 255.255.255.0 (/24) has 24 binary 1s, for a prefix length of 24 bits. P = 24 H = 8 8 0s24 1s 11111111 11111111 0000000011111111 Figure 15-5 Mask 255.255.255.0: P=24, H=8 Masks and Class Divide Addresses into Three Parts In addition to the two-part view of IPv4 addresses, you can also think about IPv4 addresses as having three parts. To do so, just apply Class A, B, and C rules to the address format to define the network part at the beginning of the address. This added logic divides the prefix into two parts: the network part and the subnet part. The class defines the length of the network part, with the subnet part simply being the rest of the prefix. Figure 15-6 shows the idea. Network Host Size: 8, 16, 24 (A, B, C) Mask 0sMask 1s Subnet Figure 15-6 Class Concepts Applied to Create Three Parts 350 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The combined network and subnet parts act like the prefix because all addresses in the same subnet must have identical values in the network and subnet parts. The size of the host part remains unchanged, whether viewing the addresses as having two parts or three parts. To be complete, Figure 15-7 shows the same example as in the previous section, with the subnet of “all addresses that begin with 10.1.1.” In that example, the subnet uses mask 255.255.255.0, and the addresses are all in Class A network 10.0.0.0. The class defines 8 net- work bits, and the mask defines 24 prefix bits, meaning that 24 – 8 = 16 subnet bits exist. The host part remains as 8 bits per the mask.

Classful addressing means that you think about Class A, B, and C rules, so the prefix is separated into the network and subnet parts, as shown in Figures 15-6 and 15-7. Classless addressing means that you ignore the Class A, B, and C rules and treat the prefix part as one part, as shown in Figures 15-4 and 15-5. The following more formal definitions are listed for reference and study: Classless addressing: The concept that an IPv4 address has two parts—the prefix part plus the host part—as defined by the mask, with no consideration of the class (A, B, or C). Classful addressing: The concept that an IPv4 address has three parts—network, subnet, and host—as defined by the mask and Class A, B, and C rules. NOTE Unfortunately, the networking world uses the terms classless and classful in a couple of different ways. In addition to the classless and classful addressing described here, each routing protocol can be categorized as either a classless routing protocol or a class- ful routing protocol. In addition, the terms classless routing and classful routing refer to some details of how Cisco routers forward (route) packets using the default route in some cases. As a result, these terms can be easily confused and misused. So, when you see the words classless and classful, be careful to note the context: addressing, routing, or routing protocols. Calculations Based on the IPv4 Address Format After you know how to break an address down using both classless and classful addressing rules, you can easily calculate a couple of important facts using some basic math formulas. Chapter 15: Analyzing Subnet Masks 351 15 First, for any subnet, after you know the number of host bits, you can calculate the number of host IP addresses in the subnet. Next, if you know the number of subnet bits (using class- ful addressing concepts) and you know that only one subnet mask is used throughout the network, you can also calculate the number of subnets in the network. The formulas just require that you know the powers of 2: Hosts in the subnet: 2H – 2, where H is the number of host bits. Subnets in the network: 2S, where S is the number of subnet bits. Only use this formula if only one mask is used throughout the network. NOTE The section “Choose the Mask” in Chapter 13, “Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting,” details many concepts related to masks, including comments about this assumption of one mask throughout a single Class A, B, or C network. The sizes of the parts of IPv4 addresses can also be calculated. The math is basic, but the concepts are important. Keeping in mind that IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, the two parts with classless addressing must add up to 32 (P + H = 32), and with classful addressing, the three parts must add up to 32 (N + S + H = 32). Figure 15-8 shows the relationships. 32 /P N HS Class: A: N = 8 B: N = 16 C: N = 24 Figure 15-8 Relationship Between /P, N, S, and H You often begin with an IP address and mask, both when answering questions on the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams and when examining problems that occur in real networks. Based on the information in this chapter and earlier chapters, you should be able to find all the information in Figure 15-8 and then calculate the number of hosts/ subnet and the number of subnets in the network. For reference, the following process spells out the steps: Step 1. Convert the mask to prefix format (/P) as needed. (See the earlier section “Practice Converting Subnet Masks” for review.) Step 2. Determine N based on the class. (See Chapter 14, “Analyzing Classful IPv4 Networks,” for review.) Step 3. Calculate S = P – N. Step 4. Calculate H = 32 – P. Step 5. Calculate hosts/subnet: 2H – 2. Step 6. Calculate number of subnet: 2S. 352 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide For example, consider the case of IP address 8.1.4.5 with mask 255.255.0.0. Following the process: Step 1. 255.255.0.0 = /16, so P=16. Step 2. 8.1.4.5 is in the range 1–126 in the first octet, so it is Class A; so N=8. Step 3. S = P – N = 16 – 8 = 8. Step 4. H = 32 – P = 32 – 16 = 16. Step 5. 216 – 2 = 65,534 hosts/subnet. Step 6. 28 = 256 subnets. Figure 15-9 shows a visual analysis of the same problem. N = 8 H = 16 16 0s16 1s 11111111 0000000011111111 S = 16 - 8 00000000 Figure 15-9 Visual Representation of Problem: 8.1.4.5, 255.255.0.0 For another example, consider address 200.1.1.1, mask 255.255.255.252. Following the process: Step 1. 255.255.255.252 = /30, so P=30. Step 2. 200.1.1.1 is in the range 192–223 in the first octet, so it is Class C; so N=24. Step 3. S = P – N = 30 – 24 = 6. Step 4. H = 32 – P = 32 – 30 = 2. Step 5. 22 – 2 = 2 hosts/subnet Step 6. 26 = 64 subnets. This example uses a popular mask for serial links, because serial links only require two host addresses, and the mask supports only two host addresses. Practice Analyzing Subnet Masks As with the other subnetting math in this book, using a two-phase approach may help. Take time now to practice until you feel like you understand the process. Then, before the exam, make sure you master the math. Table 15-9 summarizes the key concepts and suggestions for this two-phase approach.

For 8.1.4.5, the first octet (8) is in the 1–126 range, so it is a Class A address, with 8 network bits. Mask 255.255.254.0 converts to /23, so P – N = 15, for 15 subnet bits. H can be found by subtracting /P (23) from 32, for 9 host bits. 2. 130.4.102.1 is in the 128–191 range in the first octet, making it a Class B address, with N = 16 bits. 255.255.255.0 converts to /24, so the number of subnet bits is 24 – 16 = 8. With 24 prefix bits, the number of host bits is 32 – 24 = 8. 3. The third problem purposely shows a case where the mask does not create a subnet part of the address. The address, 199.1.1.100, has a first octet between 192 and 223, making it a Class C address with 24 network bits. The prefix version of the mask is /24, so the number of subnet bits is 24 – 24 = 0. The number of host bits is 32 minus the prefix length (24), for a total of 8 host bits. So in this case, the mask shows that the network engineer is using the default mask, which creates no subnet bits and no subnets. 4. With the same address as the second problem, 130.4.102.1 is a Class B address with N = 16 bits. This problem uses a different mask, 255.255.252.0, which converts to /22. This makes the number of subnet bits 22 – 16 = 6. With 22 prefix bits, the number of host bits is 32 – 22 = 10. 5. With the same address as the third problem, 199.1.1.100 is a Class C address with N = 24 bits. This problem uses a different mask, 255.255.255.224, which converts to /27. This makes the number of subnet bits 27 – 24 = 3. With 27 prefix bits, the number of host bits is 32 – 27 = 5. CHAPTER 16 Analyzing Existing Subnets This chapter covers the following exam topics: 1.0 Network Fundamentals 1.8 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot IPv4 addressing and subnetting 1.9 Compare and contrast IPv4 address types 1.9.a Unicast 1.9.b Broadcast Often, a networking task begins with the discovery of the IP address and mask used by some host. Then, to understand how the internetwork routes packets to that host, you must find key pieces of information about the subnet, specifically the following: ■ Subnet ID ■ Subnet broadcast address ■ Subnet’s range of usable unicast IP addresses This chapter discusses the concepts and math to take a known IP address and mask, and then fully describe a subnet by finding the values in this list. These specific tasks might well be the most important IP skills in the entire IP addressing and subnetting topics in this book, because these tasks might be the most commonly used tasks when operating and trouble- shooting real networks. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

A fellow engineer tells you to configure the DHCP server to lease the last 100 usable IP addresses in subnet 10.1.4.0/23. Which of the following IP addresses could be leased as a result of your new configuration? a. 10.1.4.156 b. 10.1.4.254 c. 10.1.5.200 d. 10.1.7.200 e. 10.1.255.200 Foundation Topics Defining a Subnet An IP subnet is a subset of a classful network, created by choice of some network engineer. However, that engineer cannot pick just any arbitrary subset of addresses; instead, the engi- neer must follow certain rules, such as the following: ■ The subnet contains a set of consecutive numbers. ■ The subnet holds 2H numbers, where H is the number of host bits defined by the sub- net mask. ■ Two special numbers in the range cannot be used as IP addresses: ■ The fi rst (lowest) number acts as an identifi er for the subnet (subnet ID). ■ The last (highest) number acts as a subnet broadcast address. ■ The remaining addresses, whose values sit between the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address, are used as unicast IP addresses. This section reviews and expands the basic concepts of the subnet ID, subnet broadcast address, and range of addresses in a subnet. An Example with Network 172.16.0.0 and Four Subnets Imagine that you work at the customer support center, where you receive all initial calls from users who have problems with their computer. You coach the user through finding her IP address and mask: 172.16.150.41, mask 255.255.192.0. One of the first and most com- mon tasks you will do based on that information is to find the subnet ID of the subnet in which that address resides. (In fact, this subnet ID is sometimes called the resident subnet, because the IP address exists in or resides in that subnet.) Before getting into the math, examine the mask (255.255.192.0) and classful network (172.16.0.0) for a moment. From the mask, based on what you learned in Chapter 15, “Analyzing Subnet Masks,” you can find the structure of the addresses in the subnet, includ- ing the number of host and subnet bits. That analysis tells you that two subnet bits exist, meaning that there should be four (22) subnets. Figure 16-1 shows the idea. Chapter 16: Analyzing Existing Subnets 359 16 N = 16 H = 14S = 2 /P = N + S = /18 Subnets = 22 Hosts = 214 - 2 Figure 16-1 Address Structure: Class B Network, /18 Mask NOTE This chapter, like the others in this part of the book, assumes that one mask is used throughout an entire classful network. Because each subnet uses a single mask, all subnets of this single IP network must be the same size, because all subnets have the same structure. In this example, all four subnets will have the structure shown in the figure, so all four subnets will have 214 – 2 host addresses. Next, consider the big picture of what happens with this example subnet design: The one Class B network now has four subnets of equal size. Conceptually, if you represent the entire Class B network as a number line, each subnet consumes one-fourth of the number line, as shown in Figure 16-2. Each subnet has a subnet ID—the numerically lowest number in the subnet—so it sits on the left of the subnet. And each subnet has a subnet broadcast address—the numerically highest number in the subnet—so it sits on the right side of the subnet.

In other words, you see how to find the resident subnet of an IP address. Again, using IP address 172.16.150.41 and mask 255.255.192.0 as an example, Figure 16-3 shows the resident subnet, along with the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address that bracket the subnet.

When listed along with its matching subnet mask, the subnet ID identifies the subnet and can be used to derive the subnet broadcast address and range of addresses in the subnet. Rather than having to write down all these details about a subnet, you simply need to write down the subnet ID and mask, and you have enough information to fully describe the subnet. The subnet ID appears in many places, but it is seen most often in IP routing tables. For example, when an engineer configures a router with its IP address and mask, the router calcu- lates the subnet ID and puts a route into its routing table for that subnet. The router typically then advertises the subnet ID/mask combination to neighboring routers with some IP routing protocol. Eventually, all the routers in an enterprise learn about the subnet—again using the subnet ID and subnet mask combination—and display it in their routing tables. (You can dis- play the contents of a router’s IP routing table using the show ip route command.) Unfortunately, the terminology related to subnets can sometimes cause problems. First, the terms subnet ID, subnet number, and subnet address are synonyms. In addition, people sometimes simply say subnet when referring to both the idea of a subnet and the number that is used as the subnet ID. When talking about routing, people sometimes use the term prefix instead of subnet. The term prefix refers to the same idea as subnet; it just uses terminology from the classless addressing way to describe IP addresses, as discussed in Chapter 15’s section “Classless and Classful Addressing.” The biggest terminology confusion arises between the terms network and subnet. In the real world, people often use these terms synonymously, and that is perfectly reasonable in some cases. In other cases, the specific meaning of these terms, and their differences, matter to what is being discussed. For example, people often might say, “What is the network ID?” when they really want to know the subnet ID. In another case, they might want to know the Class A, B, or C net- work ID. So, when one engineer asks something like, “What’s the net ID for 172.16.150.41 slash 18?” use the context to figure out whether he wants the literal classful network ID (172.16.0.0, in this case) or the literal subnet ID (172.16.128.0, in this case). For the exams, be ready to notice when the terms subnet and network are used, and then use the context to figure out the specific meaning of the term in that case. Table 16-2 summarizes the key facts about the subnet ID, along with the possible syn- onyms, for easier review and study.

Routing tables, documentation Subnet Broadcast Address The subnet broadcast address has two main roles: to be used as a destination IP address for the purpose of sending packets to all hosts in the subnet, and as a means to find the high end of the range of addresses in a subnet. The original purpose for the subnet broadcast address was to give hosts a way to send one packet to all hosts in a subnet, and to do so efficiently. For example, a host in subnet A could send a packet with a destination address of subnet B’s subnet broadcast address. The routers would forward this one packet just like a packet sent to a host in subnet B. After the packet arrives at the router connected to subnet B, that last router would then forward the packet to all hosts in subnet B, typically by encapsulating the packet in a data link layer broadcast frame. As a result, all hosts in host B’s subnet would receive a copy of the packet. The subnet broadcast address also helps you find the range of addresses in a subnet, because the broadcast address is the last (highest) number in a subnet’s range of addresses. To find the low end of the range, calculate the subnet ID; to find the high end of the range, calculate the subnet broadcast address . Table 16-3 summarizes the key facts about the subnet broadcast address, along with the possible synonyms, for easier review and study. Table 16-3 Summary of Subnet Broadcast Address Key Facts Definition A reserved number in each subnet that, when used as the destination address of a packet, causes the device to forward the packet to all hosts in that subnet Numeric Value Last (highest) number in the subnet Literal Synonyms Directed broadcast address Broader-Use Synonyms Network broadcast Typically Seen In In calculations of the range of addresses in a subnet Range of Usable Addresses The engineers implementing an IP internetwork need to know the range of unicast IP addresses in each subnet. Before you can plan which addresses to use as statically assigned IP addresses, which to configure to be leased by the DHCP server, and which to reserve for later use, you need to know the range of usable addresses. To find the range of usable IP addresses in a subnet, first find the subnet ID and the subnet broadcast address. Then, just add 1 to the fourth octet of the subnet ID to get the first (low- est) usable address, and subtract 1 from the fourth octet of the subnet broadcast address to get the last (highest) usable address in the subnet. 362 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide For example, Figure 16-3 showed subnet ID 172.16.128.0, mask /18. The first usable address is simply one more than the subnet ID (in this case, 172.16.128.1). That same figure showed a subnet broadcast address of 172.16.191.255, so the last usable address is one less, or 172.16.191.254. Now that this section has described the concepts behind the numbers that collectively define a subnet, the rest of this chapter focuses on the math used to find these values. Analyzing Existing Subnets: Binary What does it mean to “analyze a subnet”? For this book, it means that you should be able to start with an IP address and mask and then define key facts about the subnet in which that address resides. Specifically, that means discovering the subnet ID, subnet broadcast address, and range of addresses. The analysis can also include the calculation of the num- ber of addresses in the subnet as discussed in Chapter 15, but this chapter does not review those concepts. Many methods exist to calculate the details about a subnet based on the address/mask. This section begins by discussing some calculations that use binary math, with the next section showing alternatives that use only decimal math. Although many people prefer the decimal method for going fast on the exams, the binary calculations ultimately give you a better understanding of IPv4 addressing. In particular, if you plan to move on to attain Cisco certifications beyond CCNA Routing and Switching, you should take the time to understand the binary methods discussed in this section, even if you use the deci- mal methods for the exams. Finding the Subnet ID: Binary To start this section that uses binary, first consider a simple decimal math problem. The problem: Find the smallest three-digit decimal number that begins with 4. The answer, of course, is 400. And although most people would not have to break down the logic into steps, you know that 0 is the lowest-value digit you can use for any digit in a decimal num- ber. You know that the first digit must be a 4, and the number is a three-digit number, so you just use the lowest value (0) for the last two digits, and find the answer: 400. This same concept, applied to binary IP addresses, gives you the subnet ID. You have seen all the related concepts in other chapters, so if you already intuitively know how to find the subnet ID in binary, great! If not, the following key facts should help you see the logic: All numbers in the subnet (subnet ID, subnet broadcast address, and all usable IP address- es) have the same value in the prefix part of the numbers. The subnet ID is the lowest numeric value in the subnet, so its host part, in binary, is all 0s. To find the subnet ID in binary, you take the IP address in binary and change all host bits to binary 0. To do so, you need to convert the IP address to binary. You also need to identify the prefix and host bits, which can be easily done by converting the mask (as needed) to prefix format. (Note that Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” includes a decimal- binary conversion table.) Figure 16-4 shows the idea, using the same address/mask as in the earlier examples in this chapter: 172.16.150.41, mask /18.

The second row (Step 2) shows the binary version of the IP address, converted from the dotted-decimal notation (DDN) value 172.16.150.41. (If you have not yet used the conversion table in Appendix A, it might be useful to double-check the conversion of all four octets based on the table.) The next two steps show the action to copy the IP address’s prefix bits (Step 3) and give the host bits a value of binary 0 (Step 4). This resulting number is the subnet ID (in binary). The last step, not shown in Figure 16-4, is to convert the subnet ID from binary to decimal. This book shows that conversion as a separate step, in Figure 16-5, mainly because many people make a mistake at this step in the process. When converting a 32-bit number (like an IP address or IP subnet ID) back to an IPv4 DDN, you must follow this rule: Convert 8 bits at a time from binary to decimal, regardless of the line between the prefix and host parts of the number.

Note that the third octet (the third set of 8 bits) has 2 bits in the prefix and 6 bits in the host part of the number, but the conversion occurs for all 8 bits. 364 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide NOTE You can do the numeric conversions in Figures 16-4 and 16-5 by relying on the conversion table in Appendix A. To convert from DDN to binary, for each octet, find the decimal value in the table and then write down the 8-bit binary equivalent. To convert from binary back to DDN, for each octet of 8 bits, find the matching binary entry in the table and write down the corresponding decimal value. For example, 172 converts to binary 10101100, and 00010000 converts to decimal 16. Finding the Subnet Broadcast Address: Binary Finding the subnet broadcast address uses a similar process. To find the subnet broadcast address, use the same binary process used to find the subnet ID, but instead of setting all the host bits to the lowest value (all binary 0s), set the host part to the highest value (all binary 1s). Figure 16-6 shows the concept. ________ _________ ________________ 172.16.150.41 PPPPPPPP PP HHHHHH HHHHHHHHPPPPPPPP 00010000 10 010110 0010100110101100 00010000 10 111111 1111111110101100 16 191 255172 . .. /18 Legend: Broadcast Address Prefix: Copy Host: Set to 13 4 5 5 5 5 1 2 Figure 16-6 Finding a Subnet Broadcast Address: Binary The process in Figure 16-6 demonstrates the same first three steps shown in Figure 16-4. Specifically, it shows the identification of the prefix and host bits (Step 1), the results of converting the IP address 172.16.150.41 to binary (Step 2), and the copying of the prefix bits (first 18 bits, in this case). The difference occurs in the host bits on the right, changing all host bits (the last 14, in this case) to the largest possible value (all binary 1s). The final step converts the 32-bit subnet broadcast address to DDN format. Also, remember that with any conversion from DDN to binary or vice versa, the process always converts using 8 bits at a time. In particular, in this case, the entire third octet of binary 10111111 is converted back to decimal 191 . Binary Practice Problems Figures 16-4 and 16-5 demonstrate a process to find the subnet ID using binary math. The following process summarizes those steps in written form for easier reference and practice: Step 1. Convert the mask to prefix format to find the length of the prefix (/P) and the length of the host part (32 – P). Step 2. Convert the IP address to its 32-bit binary equivalent. Step 3. Copy the prefix bits of the IP address. Chapter 16: Analyzing Existing Subnets 365 16 Step 4. Write down 0s for the host bits. Step 5. Convert the resulting 32-bit number, 8 bits at a time, back to decimal. The process to find the subnet broadcast address is exactly the same, except in Step 4, you set the bits to 1s, as shown in Figure 16-6. Take a few moments and run through the following five practice problems on scratch paper. In each case, find both the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address. Also, record the prefix style mask: 1. 8.1.4.5, 255.255.0.0 2. 130.4.102.1, 255.255.255.0 3. 199.1.1.100, 255.255.255.0 4. 130.4.102.1, 255.255.252.0 5. 199.1.1.100, 255.255.255.224 Tables 16-4 through 16-8 show the results for the five different examples. The tables show the host bits in bold, and they include the binary version of the address and mask and the binary version of the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address .

However, you can easily predict the results in at least three of the four octets, based on the DDN mask. You can then avoid the binary math in all but one octet and reduce the number of binary conversions you need to do. First, consider an octet, and that octet only, whose DDN mask value is 255. The mask value of 255 converts to binary 11111111, which means that all 8 bits are prefix bits. Thinking through the steps in the process, at Step 2, you convert the address to some number. At Step 3, you copy the number. At Step 4, you convert the same 8-bit number back to deci- mal. All you did in those three steps, in this one octet, is convert from decimal to binary and convert the same number back to the same decimal value! In short, the subnet ID (and subnet broadcast address) are equal to the IP address in octets for which the mask is 255. For example, the resident subnet ID for 172.16.150.41, mask 255.255.192.0 is 172.16.128.0. The first two mask octets are 255. Rather than think about the binary math, you could just start by copying the address’s value in those two octets: 172.16. Another shortcut exists for octets whose DDN mask value is decimal 0, or binary 00000000. With a decimal mask value of 0, the math always results in a decimal 0 for the subnet ID, no matter the beginning value in the IP address. Specifically, just look at Steps 4 and 5 in this case: At Step 4, you would write down 8 binary 0s, and at Step 5, convert 00000000 back to decimal 0. The following revised process steps take these two shortcuts into account. However, when the mask is neither 0 nor 255, the process requires the same conversions. At most, you have to do only one octet of the conversions. To find the subnet ID, apply the logic in these steps for each of the four octets: Step 1. If the mask = 255, copy the decimal IP address for that octet. Step 2. If the mask = 0, write down a decimal 0 for that octet. Step 3. If the mask is neither 0 nor 255 in this octet, use the same binary logic as shown in the section “Finding the Subnet ID: Binary,” earlier in this chapter. Figure 16-7 shows an example of this process, again using 172.16.150.41, 255.255.192.0.

Action Legend: DDN Mask IP Address Subnet IDIP IP Figure 16-7 Binary Shortcut Example To find the subnet broadcast address, you can use a decimal shortcut similar to the one used to find the subnet ID: For DDN mask octets equal to decimal 0, set the decimal subnet broadcast address value to 255 instead of 0, as noted in the following list: Step 1. If the mask = 255, copy the decimal IP address for that octet. Step 2. If the mask = 0, write down a decimal 255 for that octet. Step 3. If the mask is neither 0 nor 255 in this octet, use the same binary logic as shown in the section “Finding the Subnet Broadcast Address: Binary,” earlier in this chapter. Brief Note About Boolean Math So far, this chapter has described how humans can use binary math to find the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address. However, computers typically use an entirely different binary process to find the same values, using a branch of mathematics called Boolean algebra. Computers already store the IP address and mask in binary form, so they do not have to do any conversions to and from decimal. Then, certain Boolean operations allow the computers to calculate the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address with just a few CPU instructions. You do not need to know Boolean math to have a good understanding of IP subnetting. However, in case you are interested, computers use the following Boolean logic to find the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address, respectively: Perform a Boolean AND of the IP address and mask. This process converts all host bits to binary 0. Invert the mask, and then perform a Boolean OR of the IP address and inverted subnet mask. This process converts all host bits to binary 1s. Finding the Range of Addresses Finding the range of usable addresses in a subnet, after you know the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address, requires only simple addition and subtraction. To find the first (lowest) usable IP address in the subnet, simply add 1 to the fourth octet of the subnet ID. To find the last (highest) usable IP address, simply subtract 1 from the fourth octet of the subnet broadcast address. 368 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Analyzing Existing Subnets: Decimal Analyzing existing subnets using the binary process works well. However, some of the math takes time for most people, particularly the decimal-binary conversions. And you need to do the math quickly for the Cisco CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams. For the exams, you really should be able to take an IP address and mask, and calculate the sub- net ID and range of usable addresses within about 15 seconds. When using binary methods, most people require a lot of practice to be able to find these answers, even when using the abbreviated binary process. This section discusses how to find the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address using only decimal math. Most people can find the answers more quickly using this process, at least after a little practice, as compared with the binary process. However, the decimal process does not tell you anything about the meaning behind the math. So, if you have not read the earlier section “Analyzing Existing Subnets: Binary,” it is worthwhile to read it for the sake of understanding subnetting. This section focuses on getting the right answer using a method that, after you have practiced, should be faster . Analysis with Easy Masks With three easy subnet masks in particular, finding the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address requires only easy logic and literally no math. Three easy masks exist: 255.0.0.0 255.255.0.0 255.255.255.0 These easy masks have only 255 and 0 in decimal. In comparison, difficult masks have one octet that has neither a 255 nor a 0 in the mask, which makes the logic more challenging. NOTE The terms easy mask and difficult mask are terms created for use in this book to describe the masks and the level of difficulty when working with each. When the problem uses an easy mask, you can quickly find the subnet ID based on the IP address and mask in DDN format. Just use the following process for each of the four octets to find the subnet ID: Step 1. If the mask octet = 255, copy the decimal IP address. Step 2. If the mask octet = 0, write a decimal 0. A similar simple process exists to find the subnet broadcast address, as follows: Step 1. If the mask octet = 255, copy the decimal IP address. Step 2. If the mask octet = 0, write a decimal 255. Before moving to the next section, take some time to fill in the blanks in Table 16-9. Check your answers against Table 16-15 in the section “Answers to Earlier Practice Problems,” later in this chapter. Complete the table by listing the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address. Chapter 16: Analyzing Existing Subnets 369 16 Table 16-9 Practice Problems: Find Subnet ID and Broadcast, Easy Masks IP Address Mask Subnet ID Broadcast Address 1 10.77.55.3 255.255.255.0 2 172.30.99.4 255.255.255.0 3 192.168.6.54 255.255.255.0 4 10.77.3.14 255.255.0.0 5 172.22.55.77 255.255.0.0 6 1.99.53.76 255.0.0.0 Predictability in the Interesting Octet Although three masks are easier to work with (255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, and 255.255.255.0), the rest make the decimal math a little more difficult, so we call these masks difficult masks. With difficult masks, one octet is neither a 0 nor a 255. The math in the other three octets is easy and boring, so this book calls the one octet with the more difficult math the interesting octet. If you take some time to think about different problems and focus on the interesting octet, you will begin to see a pattern. This section takes you through that examination so that you can learn how to predict the pattern, in decimal, and find the subnet ID. First, the subnet ID value has a predictable decimal value because of the assumption that a single subnet mask is used for all subnets of a single classful network. The chapters in this part of the book assume that, for a given classful network, the design engineer chooses to use a single subnet mask for all subnets. (See the section “One Size Subnet Fits All—Or Not” in Chapter 13, “Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting,” for more details.) To see that predictability, consider some planning information written down by a network engineer, as shown in Figure 16-8. The figure shows four different masks the engineer is considering using in an IPv4 network, along with Class B network 172.16.0.0. The figure shows the third-octet values for the subnet IDs that would be created when using mask 255.255.128.0, 255.255.192.0, 255.255.224.0, and 255.255.240.0, from top to bottom in the figure. Subnets of 172.16.0.0: 172.16.___.0 2 Subnets 255.255.128.0 4 Subnets 255.255.192.0 2400 16 32 48 64 80 96 112 128 144 160 176 192 208 224 0 64 128 192 0 128 0 32 64 96 128 160 192 224 8 Subnets 255.255.224.0 16 Subnets 255.255.240.0 Figure 16-8 Numeric Patterns in the Interesting Octet 370 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide First, to explain the figure further, look at the top row of the figure. If the engineer uses 255.255.128.0 as the mask, the mask creates two subnets, with subnet IDs 172.16.0.0 and 172.16.128.0. If the engineer uses mask 255.255.192.0, the mask creates four subnets, with subnet IDs 172.16.0.0, 172.16.64.0, 172.16.128.0, and 172.16.192.0. If you take the time to look at the figure, the patterns become obvious. In this case: Mask: 255.255.128.0 Pattern: Multiples of 128 Mask: 255.255.192.0 Pattern: Multiples of 64 Mask: 255.255.224.0 Pattern: Multiples of 32 Mask: 255.255.240.0 Pattern: Multiples of 16 To find the subnet ID, you just need a way to figure out what the pattern is. If you start with an IP address and mask, just find the subnet ID closest to the IP address, without going over, as discussed in the next section. Finding the Subnet ID: Difficult Masks The following written process lists all the steps to find the subnet ID, using only decimal math. This process adds to the earlier process used with easy masks. For each octet: Step 1. If the mask octet = 255, copy the decimal IP address. Step 2. If the mask octet = 0, write a decimal 0. Step 3. If the mask is neither, refer to this octet as the interesting octet: A. Calculate the magic number as 256 – mask. B. Set the subnet ID’s value to the multiple of the magic number that is closest to the IP address without going over. The process uses two new terms created for this book: magic number and interesting octet. The term interesting octet refers to the octet identified at Step 3 in the process; in other words, it is the octet with the mask that is neither 255 nor 0. Step 3A then uses the term magic number, which is derived from the DDN mask. Conceptually, the magic number is the number you add to one subnet ID to get the next subnet ID in order, as shown in Figure 16-8. Numerically, it can be found by subtracting the DDN mask’s value, in the interesting octet, from 256, as mentioned in Step 3A. The best way to learn this process is to see it happen. In fact, if you can, stop reading now, use the DVD accompanying this book, and watch the videos about finding the subnet ID with a difficult mask. These videos demonstrate this process. You can also use the examples on the next few pages that show the process being used on paper. Then, follow the practice opportu- nities outlined in the section “Practice Analyzing Existing Subnets,” later in this chapter. Resident Subnet Example 1 For example, consider the requirement to find the resident subnet for IP address 130.4.102.1, mask 255.255.240.0. The process does not require you to think about prefix bits versus host bits, convert the mask, think about the mask in binary, or convert the IP address to and from binary. Instead, for each of the four octets, choose an action based on the value in the mask. Figure 16-9 shows the results; the circled numbers in the figure refer to the step numbers in the written process to find the subnet ID, as listed in the previous few pages.

The process keys on the mask, and the first two octets have a mask value of 255, so simply copy the IP address to the place where you intend to write down the subnet ID. The fourth octet has a mask value of 0, so write down a 0 for the fourth octet of the subnet ID. The most challenging logic occurs in the interesting octet, which is the third octet in this example, because of the mask value 240 in that octet. For this octet, Step 3A asks you to calculate the magic number as 256 – mask. That means you take the mask’s value in the interesting octet (240, in this case) and subtract it from 256: 256 – 240 = 16. The subnet ID’s value in this octet must be a multiple of decimal 16, in this case. Step 3B then asks you to find the multiples of the magic number (16, in this case) and choose the one closest to the IP address without going over. Specifically, that means that you should mentally calculate the multiples of the magic number, starting at 0. (Do not forget to start at 0!) Count, starting at 0: 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, and so on. Then, find the multiple closest to the IP address value in this octet (102, in this case), without going over 102. So, as shown in Figure 16-9, you make the third octet’s value 96 to complete the subnet ID of 130.4.96.0. Resident Subnet Example 2 Consider another example: 192.168.5.77, mask 255.255.255.224. Figure 16-10 shows the results. ID 0-255 5. .. 168 64192 1 311 5168 77192 . .. 255255 256 –224 32 224255 . ..

For each octet, each with a mask value of 255, just copy the IP address. For the interesting octet, at Step 3A, the magic number is 256 – 224 = 32. The multiples of the magic number are 0, 32, 64, 96, and so on. Because the IP address value in the fourth octet is 77, in this case, the multiple must be the number closest to 77 without going over; therefore, the subnet ID ends with 64, for a value of 192.168.5.64. Resident Subnet Practice Problems Before moving to the next section, take some time to fill in the blanks in Table 16-10. Check your answers against Table 16-16 in the section “Answers to Earlier Practice Problems,” later in this chapter. Complete the table by listing the subnet ID in each case. The text following Table 16-16 also lists explanations for each problem.

For simplicity, this pro- cess begins with the subnet ID, rather than the IP address. If you happen to start with an IP address instead, use the processes in this chapter to first find the subnet ID, and then use the following process to find the subnet broadcast address for that same subnet. For each octet: Step 1. If the mask octet = 255, copy the subnet ID. Step 2. If the mask octet = 0, write 255. Step 3. If the mask is neither, identify this octet as the interesting octet: A. Calculate the magic number as 256 – mask. B. Take the subnet ID’s value, add the magic number, and subtract 1 (ID + magic – 1). As with the similar process used to find the subnet ID, you have several options for how to best learn and internalize the process. If you can, stop reading now, use the DVD accom- panying this book, and watch the videos about finding the subnet broadcast address with a difficult mask. Also, look at the examples in this section, which show the process being used on paper. Then, follow the practice opportunities outlined in the section “Additional Practice for This Chapter’s Processes.” Subnet Broadcast Example 1 The first example continues the first example from the section “Finding the Subnet ID: Difficult Masks,” earlier in this chapter, as demonstrated in Figure 16-9. That example started Chapter 16: Analyzing Existing Subnets 373 16 with the IP address/mask of 130.4.102.1, 255.255.240.0, and showed how to find subnet ID 130.4.96.0. Figure 16-11 now begins with that subnet ID and the same mask. 111. .. 4 255130 1 231 +Magic –1 Copy 255Copy . .. 240255 256 –240 160255 . .. 964 0130ID 0-255 Action Figure 16-11 Find the Subnet Broadcast: 130.4.96.0, 255.255.240.0 First, examine the three uninteresting octets (1, 2, and 4). The process keys on the mask, and the first two octets have a mask value of 255, so simply copy the subnet ID to the place where you intend to write down the subnet broadcast address. The fourth octet has a mask value of 0, so write down a 255 for the fourth octet. The logic related to the interesting octet occurs in the third octet in this example, because of the mask value 240. First, Step 3A asks you to calculate the magic number, as 256 – mask. (If you had already calculated the subnet ID using the decimal process in this book, you should already know the magic number.) At Step 3B, you take the subnet ID’s value (96), add the magic number (16), and subtract 1, for a total of 111. That makes the subnet broadcast address 130.4.111.255. Subnet Broadcast Example 2 Again, this example continues an earlier example, from the section “Resident Subnet Example 2,” as demonstrated in Figure 16-10. That example started with the IP address/ mask of 192.168.5.77, mask 255.255.255.224 and showed how to find subnet ID 192.168.5.64. Figure 16-12 now begins with that subnet ID and the same mask.

First, Step 3A asks you to calculate the magic number, as 256 – mask. (If you had already calculated the subnet ID, it is the same magic num- ber, because the same mask is used.) At Step 3B, you take the subnet ID’s value (64), add magic (32), and subtract 1, for a total of 95. That makes the subnet broadcast address 192.168.5.95. Subnet Broadcast Address Practice Problems Before moving to the next section, take some time to do several practice problems on a scratch piece of paper. Go back to Table 16-10, which lists IP addresses and masks, and practice by finding the subnet broadcast address for all the problems in that table. Then check your answers against Table 16-17 in the section “Answers to Earlier Practice Problems,” later in this chapter. Practice Analyzing Existing Subnets As with the other subnetting math in this book, using a two-phase approach may help. Take time now to practice until you feel like you understand the process. Then, before the exam, make sure you master the math. Table 16-11 summarizes the key concepts and suggestions for this two-phase approach. Table 16-11 Keep-Reading and Take-Exam Goals for This Chapter’s Topics Time Frame Before Moving to the Next Chapter Before Taking the Exam Focus On...

The processes also use a DDN mask, so if an exam question gives you a prefix-style mask, you need to convert to DDN format before using the process in this book. Over the years, some people have told me they prefer to memorize a table to find the magic number.

Part IV Review Review Key Topics Review all key topics in all chapters in this part, either by browsing the chapters or by using the Key Topics application on the DVD or companion website. Create Terminology Mind Map The topic of IPv4 addressing and subnetting happens to have many terms that are literal syn- onyms, many terms with similar meanings, along with terms that describe something about another term. So, create a mind map (call it map A) to organize all IP addressing and subnet- ting terms you remember. Use four main topic areas: IP addressing, IP networks, IP subnets, and masks. Inside these, subdivide terms as to whether they are either a synonym, a similar term, or a description. Figure P4-1 shows the beginnings of one branch of the mind map to give you the general idea. For this branch, you would just remember any terms related to “IP address” and place them into one of these three categories. Your map can of course look different. As usual, first do this exercise without the book or your notes. Later, when you do look at the book again, make sure that you have at least included all the key terms from the ends of the chapters.

Start at blog.certskills.com/ccent. This page intentionally left blank Part V of this book presents the foundations of what a Cisco router does and how to con- figure Cisco routers to implement those features. Much like Part II of this book introduced switch features, switch CLI, and all the common features most sites would use in Cisco switches, Part V walks through the most common features for Cisco routers. Chapter 17 focuses on the basics of installing and operating a Cisco router. However, rout- ers need some configuration before they can correctly route packets. So, Chapters 18 and 19 then show how routers learn the required IP addresses and subnets so that routers can do their jobs of routing IPv4 packets to all destinations. Chapter 18 first looks at configuring IP addresses, as well as static IP routes. Chapter 19 then shows how routers can dynamically learn about remote subnets using a routing protocol, in this case the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Version 2. Chapter 20 closes Part V with more of a host focus on the IPv4 network. This section walks through what happens when a host first connects to the network, first discovering its own IPv4 address with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), resolving hostnames with Domain Name System (DNS), and then learning IP-MAC mapping information with Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). Part V Implementing IPv4 Chapter 17: Operating Cisco Routers Chapter 18: Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes Chapter 19: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2 Chapter 20: DHCP and IP Networking on Hosts Part V Review CHAPTER 17 Operating Cisco Routers This chapter covers the following exam topics: 1.0 Network Fundamentals 1.6 Select the appropriate cabling type based on implementation requirements 1.8 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot IPv4 addressing and subnetting 5.0 Infrastructure Management 5.3 Configure and verify initial device configuration Getting an IPv4 network up and working requires some basic steps: installing routers, con- figuring their IPv4 addresses, optionally configuring some static IPv4 routes, and then con- figuring a routing protocol to dynamically learn routes. This chapter focuses on Step 1: how to install an enterprise-class Cisco router, with just enough configuration to get the router working, ready for those next steps. This chapter breaks the topics into two major headings. The first discusses the physical instal- lation of an enterprise-class Cisco router. The second section looks at the command-line inter- face (CLI) on a Cisco router, which has the same look and feel as the Cisco switch CLI. This section first lists the similarities between a switch and router CLI, and then introduces the configuration required to make the router start forwarding IP packets on its interfaces. “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

As introduced in Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing,” routers forward packets by connecting to various physical network links, like Ethernet, serial links, and Frame Relay, and then using Layer 3 routing logic to choose where to forward each packet. As a reminder, Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” covered the details of making those physical connections to Ethernet networks, while Chapter 3, “Fundamentals of WANs,” covered the basics of cabling with WAN links. This section examines some of the details of router installation and cabling, first from the enterprise perspective and then from the perspective of connecting a typical small office/ home office (SOHO) to an ISP using high-speed Internet. Installing Enterprise Routers A typical enterprise network has a few centralized sites as well as lots of smaller remote sites. To support devices at each site (the computers, IP phones, printers, and other devices), the network includes at least one LAN switch at each site. In addition, each site has a router, which connects to the LAN switch and to some WAN link. The WAN link provides connec- tivity from each remote site, back to the central site, and to other sites through the connec- tion to the central site. Figures 17-1 and 17-2 show contrasting ways to draw parts of an enterprise network. Both show a typical branch office on the left, with a router and some end-user PCs. The central site, on the right, has basically the same components, plus some servers. The sites connect using a point-to-point serial link connecting the two routers. The first figure omits many of the cabling details, making the figure more useful when you want to discuss general Layer 3 concepts; the second figure shows the cabling details.

In particular, routers use the same Ethernet cabling pinouts as PCs, so each router uses a UTP cable with a straight-through pinout. Next, consider the hardware on the ends of the serial link, in particular where the channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU) hardware resides on each end of the serial link. It sits either outside the router as a separate device (as shown on the left) or integrated into the router’s serial interface hardware (as shown on the right). Most new installations today include the CSU/DSU in the router’s serial interface. Finally, the serial link requires some cabling inside the same wiring closet or other space between where the telco serial line terminates and where the router sits on a shelf or in a rack. The WAN cable installed by the telco typically has an RJ-48 connector, which is the same size and shape as an RJ-45 connector. The telco cable with the RJ-48 connector inserts into the CSU/DSU. In the example of Figure 17-2, at the central site, the telco cable con- nects directly into the router’s serial interface. At the branch office router, the cable con- nects to the external CSU/DSU, which then connects to the router serial interface using some other serial cable. (As a reminder, Chapter 3’s section “Leased-Line Cabling” intro- duced the basics of this cabling.) Cisco Integrated Services Routers Product vendors, including Cisco, typically provide several different types of router hard- ware. Today, routers often do much more work than simply routing packets—in fact, they serve as a device or platform from which to provide many network services. Cisco even brands their enterprise routers not just as routers, but as “integrated services routers,” emphasizing the multi-purpose nature of the products. As an example, consider the networking functions needed at a typical branch office. A typi- cal enterprise branch office needs a router for WAN/LAN connectivity, and a LAN switch to provide a high-performance local network and connectivity into the router and WAN. Many branches also need Voice over IP (VoIP) services to support IP phones, and several security services as well. Plus, it is hard to imagine a site with users that does not have Wi-Fi access today. So, rather than require multiple separate devices at one site, as shown in Figure 17-2, Cisco offers single devices that act as both router and switch, and provide other functions as well. 388 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide For the sake of learning and understanding the different functions, the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching exams focus on using a separate switch and separate router, which provides a much cleaner path for learning the basics. Figure 17-3 shows a couple of pictures of the Cisco 4321 ISR, with some of the more important features highlighted. The top part of the figure shows a full view of the back of the router. This model comes with two built-in Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and two modular slots that allow you to add small cards called Network Interface Modules (NIMs). The bot- tom of the figure shows one example NIM (a NIM that provides two serial interfaces). The router has other items as well, including both an RJ-45 and USB console port. 2-Port Serial NIM Gi0/1 Aux 2 NIM Slots RS-45 Console Gi0/0 (RJ-45 or SFP) USB Figure 17-3 Photos of a Model 4321 Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) Physical Installation Armed with the cabling details in figures like Figure 17-2, and the router hardware details in figures like Figure 17-3, you can physically install a router. To install a router, follow these steps: Step 1. Connect any LAN cables to the LAN ports. Step 2. If using an external CSU/DSU, connect the router’s serial interface to the CSU/DSU and the CSU/DSU to the line from the telco. Step 3. If using an internal CSU/DSU, connect the router’s serial interface to the line from the telco. Step 4. Connect the router’s console port to a PC (using a rollover cable), as needed, to configure the router. Step 5. Connect a power cable from a power outlet to the power port on the router. Step 6. Power on the router. Note that the steps for router installation match those for a switch, except that Cisco enter- prise routers typically have an on/off switch, while switches do not. Chapter 17: Operating Cisco Routers 389 17 Installing Internet Access Routers Routers play a key role in SOHO networks, connecting the LAN-attached end-user devices to a high-speed Internet access service. However, most SOHO products go by the name router, but happen to include many networking functions in a single device. Because of that, when learning about networking, it can be difficult to appreciate the different func- tions the device performs. To help you understand the features of a router product used in a SOHO environment, Figure 17-4 first shows an example in which the SOHO network uses separate devices for each function. The first shows the devices and cabling, with a connection to the Internet using cable TV (CATV) as the high-speed Internet service. CATV Cable Cable ModemUTP UTPUTP SOHO R1 ISP/Internet UTP RouterSwitch Access Point Figure 17-4 Devices in a SOHO Network with High-Speed CATV Internet This figure has many similarities to Figure 17-2, which shows a typical enterprise branch office. Some end-user PCs still connect with cabling to a switch, and the switch still con- nects to a router’s Ethernet interface. Other end-user devices use a wireless LAN, with a wireless access point, that also connects to the Ethernet LAN. For both the wired and wire- less devices, the router still provides routing services, forwarding IP packets. The main differences between the SOHO connection in Figure 17-4 and the enterprise branch in Figure 17-2 relate to the connection into the Internet. An Internet connection that uses CATV or digital subscriber line (DSL) needs a device that converts between the Layer 1 and 2 standards used on the CATV cable or DSL line and the Ethernet used by the router. These devices, commonly called cable modems and DSL modems, respectively, convert between CATV Layer 1 and Layer 2 standards to Ethernet, and vice versa. Similarly, DSL modems convert between the DSL signals over a home telephone line and Ethernet. To physically install a SOHO network with the devices shown in Figure 17-4, you basi- cally need the correct UTP cables for the Ethernet connections, and either the CATV cable (for cable Internet services) or a phone line (for DSL services). Note that the router used in Figure 17-4 simply needs to have two Ethernet interfaces—one to connect to the LAN switch and one to connect to the cable modem. Today, most new SOHO installations use an integrated device rather than the separate devices shown in Figure 17-4. Consumer-grade devices are often called cable routers or DSL routers, while in fact they do all the functions shown in Figure 17-4, including the roles of ■ Router ■ Switch 390 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide ■ Cable or DSL modem ■ Wireless access point ■ Hardware-enabled encryption A newly installed high-speed SOHO Internet connection today probably looks more like Figure 17-5, with an integrated device. UTP CATV Cable SOHO R1 ISP/Internet Figure 17-5 SOHO Network, Using Cable Internet and an Integrated Device Enabling IPv4 Support on Cisco Router Interfaces Routers support a relatively large number of features, with a large number of configuration and EXEC commands to support those features. You will learn about many of these fea- tures throughout the rest of this book. NOTE For perspective, the Cisco router documentation includes a command reference, with an index to every single router command. A quick informal count of a recent IOS ver- sion listed around 5000 CLI commands. This second section of the chapter focuses on commands related to router interfaces. To make routers work—that is, to route IPv4 packets—the interfaces must be configured. This section introduces the most common commands that configure interfaces, make them work, and give the interfaces IP addresses and masks. Accessing the Router CLI Accessing a router’s command-line interface (CLI) works much like a switch. In fact, it works so much like accessing a Cisco switch CLI that this book relies on Chapter 6, “Using the Command-Line Interface,” instead of repeating the same details here. If the details from Chapter 6 are not fresh in your memory, it might be worthwhile to spend a few minutes briefly reviewing Chapter 6 as well as Chapter 9, “Configuring Switch Interfaces,” before reading further. Cisco switches and routers share many of the same CLI navigation features, and many of the same configuration commands for management features. The following list mentions the highlights: ■ User and Enable (privileged) mode ■ Entering and exiting configuration mode, using the configure terminal, end, and exit commands and the Ctrl+Z key sequence Chapter 17: Operating Cisco Routers 391 17 ■ Configuration of console, Telnet (vty), and enable secret passwords ■ Configuration of Secure Shell (SSH) encryption keys and username/password login credentials ■ Configuration of the hostname and interface description ■ Configuration of Ethernet interfaces that can negotiate speed using the speed and duplex commands ■ Configuration of an interface to be administratively disabled ( shutdown) and administra- tively enabled ( no shutdown) ■ Navigation through different configuration mode contexts using commands like line console 0 and interface type number ■ CLI help, command editing, and command recall features ■ The meaning and use of the startup-config (in NVRAM), running-config (in RAM), and external servers (like TFTP), along with how to use the copy command to copy the con- figuration files and IOS images At first glance, this list seems to cover most everything covered in Chapter 8—and it does cover most of the details; however, a couple of topics covered in Chapter 8 do work differ- ently with the router CLI as compared to the switch CLI, as follows: ■ The configuration of IP addresses differs in some ways, with switches using a VLAN interface and routers using an IP address configured on each working interface. ■ Many Cisco router models have an auxiliary (Aux) port, intended to be connected to an external modem and phone line to allow remote users to dial in to the router, and access the CLI, by making a phone call. Cisco switches do not have auxiliary ports. ■ Router IOS defaults to disallow both Telnet and SSH into the router because of the default setting of transport input none in vty configuration mode. Chapter 8, “Configuring Basic Switch Management,” already discussed the various options on this command to enable Telnet (transport input telnet), SSH (transport input ssh), or both (transport input all or transport input telnet ssh). The router CLI also differs from a switch CLI just because switches and routers do different things. For example, Cisco Layer 2 switches support the show mac address-table command, but these Layer 2–only devices do not support the show ip route command, which routers use to list IPv4 routes. Some Cisco routers can do IP routing but not Layer 2 switching, so they support the show ip route command but not the show mac address-table command. NOTE The book includes a video that shows how to navigate the router CLI; you can find this video on the DVD and on the companion website. Router Interfaces One minor difference between Cisco switches and routers is that routers support a much wider variety of interfaces. Today, LAN switches support Ethernet LAN interfaces of vari- ous speeds. Routers support a variety of other types of interfaces, including serial interfac- es, cable TV, DSL, 3G/4G wireless, and others not mentioned in this book. 392 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Most Cisco routers have at least one Ethernet interface of some type. Many of those Ethernet interfaces support multiple speeds and use autonegotiation, so for consistency, the router IOS refers to these interfaces based on the fastest speed. For example, a 10-Mbps- only Ethernet interface would be configured with the interface ethernet number configura- tion command, a 10/100 interface with the interface fastethernet number command, and a 10/100/1000 interface with the interface gigabitethernet number command. Some Cisco routers have serial interfaces. As you might recall from Chapter 3, Cisco routers use serial interfaces to connect to a serial link. Each point-to-point serial link can then use High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC, the default) or Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). Routers refer to interfaces in many commands, first by the type of interface (Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Serial, and so on) and then with a unique number of that router. On routers, the interface numbers might be a single number, two numbers separated by a slash, or three numbers separated by slashes. For example, all three of the following configuration com- mands are correct on at least one model of Cisco router: interface ethernet 0 interface fastEthernet 0/1 interface gigabitethernet 0/0 interface serial 1/0/1 Two of the most common commands to display the interfaces, and their status, are the show ip interface brief and show interfaces commands. The first of these commands dis- plays a list with one line per interface, with some basic information, including the interface IP address and interface status. The second command lists the interfaces, but with a large amount of information per interface. Example 17-1 shows a sample of each command. Example 17-1 Listing the Interfaces in a Router R1# show ip interface brief Interface IP-Address OK?

For example, sh int fa0/0 can be used instead of show interfaces fastethernet 0/0. In fact, many network engineers, when looking over someone’s shoul- der, would say something like “just do a show int F-A-oh-oh command” in this case, rather than speaking the long version of the command. Also, note that the show interfaces command lists a text interface description on about the third line, if configured. In this case, interface S0/0/0 had been previously configured with the description Link in lab to R2’s S0/0/1 command in interface configuration mode for interface S0/0/0. The description interface subcommand provides an easy way to keep small notes about what router interfaces connect to which neighboring devices, with the show interfaces command listing that information. Interface Status Codes Each interface has two interface status codes. To be usable, the two interface status codes must be in an “up” state. The first status code refers essentially to whether Layer 1 is work- ing, and the second status code mainly (but not always) refers to whether the data link layer protocol is working. Table 17-2 summarizes these two status codes. Table 17-2 Interface Status Codes and Their Meanings Name Location General Meaning Line status First status code Refers to the Layer 1 status. (For example, is the cable installed, is it the right/wrong cable, is the device on the other end powered on?) Protocol status Second status code Refers generally to the Layer 2 status. It is always down if the line status is down. If the line status is up, a protocol status of down is usually caused by a mismatched data link layer configuration. Several combinations of interface status codes exist, as summarized in Table 17-3. The table lists the status codes in order, from being disabled on purpose by the configuration to a fully working state. 394 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Table 17-3 Typical Combinations of Interface Status Codes Line Status Protocol Status Typical Reasons Administratively down Down The interface has a shutdown command configured on it. Down Down The interface is not shutdown, but the physical layer has a problem. For example, no cable has been attached to the interface, or with Ethernet, the switch interface on the other end of the cable is shut down or the switch is powered off. Up Down Almost always refers to data link layer problems, most often configuration problems. For example, serial links have this combination when one router was configured to use PPP and the other defaults to use HDLC. Up Up Layer 1 and Layer 2 of this interface are functioning. For some examples, look back at Example 17-1’s show ip interface brief command, to the three interfaces in the following list. The interfaces in this list each have a different combi- nation of interface status codes; the list details the specific reasons for this status code in the lab used to create this example for the book. G0/0 : The interface is down/down, in this case because no cable was connected to the interface. G0/1 : The interface is administratively down/down, because the configuration includes the shutdown command under the G0/1 interface. S0/0/0 : The interface is up/up because a serial cable is installed, connected to another router in a lab, and is working. Router Interface IP Addresses Cisco enterprise routers require at least some configuration beyond the default configura- tion before they will do their primary job: routing IP packets. The following facts tell us that to make a router ready to route IPv4 packets on an interface, you need to enable the interface and assign it an IPv4 address: ■ Most Cisco router interfaces default to a disabled (shutdown) state and should be enabled with the no shutdown interface subcommand. ■ Cisco routers do not route IP packets in or out an interface until an IP address and mask have been configured; by default, no interfaces have an IP address and mask. ■ Cisco routers attempt to route IP packets for any interfaces that are in an up/up state and that have an IP address/mask assigned. To configure the address and mask, simply use the ip address address mask interface sub- command. Figure 17-6 shows a simple IPv4 network, the same network used in several of the subnetting examples in Part IV of this book. The figure shows the IPv4 addresses on Router R1, with Example 17-2 showing the matching configuration.

Examples 17-1 and 17-3 showed samples of the key show commands, while Table 17-4 summarizes those commands and the types of information they display. Table 17-4 Key Commands to List Router Interface Status Command Lines of Output per Interface IP Configuration Listed Interface Status Listed? show ip interface brief 1 Address Yes show protocols [type number] 1 or 2 Address/mask Yes show interfaces [type number] Many Address/mask Yes Bandwidth and Clock Rate on Serial Interfaces Cisco happens to place more of the WAN technologies in the ICND2 half of CCNA Routing and Switching exam content; however, you also need to be able to practice router configurations for ICND1 exam preparation, which could include using serial interfaces on any routers you buy or borrow for your lab. If you decide to build your own study lab with real gear, you need to know just a little more information about serial links. This last topic in the chapter discusses those details. As mentioned back in Chapter 3, WAN serial links can run at a wide variety of speeds. To deal with the wide range of speeds, routers physically slave themselves to the speed as dic- tated by the CSU/DSU through a process called clocking. As a result, routers can use serial links without the need for additional configuration or autonegotiation to sense the serial link’s speed. The CSU/DSU knows the speed, the CSU/DSU sends clock pulses over the cable to the router, and the router reacts to the clocking signal. To build a serial link in a home lab, the routers can use serial interface cards that normally use an external CSU/DSU, and make a serial link, without requiring the expense of two CSU/DSUs. Chapter 3’s Figure 3-5 introduced this concept, and it is repeated here as Figure 17-7. To make it work, the link uses two serial cables—one a DTE cable and the other a DCE cable—which swap the transmit and receive pair on the cables. Serial Cable Serial Cable DTE DCE clock rate Command Goes Here Tx Rx Tx Rx Tx Rx Tx Rx DTE Cable DCE Cable Router 2Router 1 Figure 17-7 Serial Link in Lab Chapter 17: Operating Cisco Routers 397 17 Using the correct cabling works, as long as you add one command: the clock rate interface subcommand. This command tells that router the speed at which to transmit bits on a serial link like the one shown in Figure 17-7. The clock rate command is not needed on real serial links, because the CSU/DSU provides the clocking. When you create a serial link in the lab using cables, without any real CSU/DSUs on the link, the router with the DCE cable must supply that clocking function, and the clock rate command tells the router to provide it. NOTE Newer router IOS versions automatically add a default clock rate 2000000 com- mand on serial interfaces that have a DCE cable connected to them. While helpful, this speed might be too high for some types of back-to-back serial cables, so consider using a lower speed in lab. Example 17-4 shows the configuration of the clock rate command using the same Router R1 used in the earlier Example 17-2. The end of the example verifies that this router can use the clock rate command with the show controllers command. This command confirms that R1 has a V.35 DCE cable connected. Example 17-4 Router R1 Configuration with the clock rate Command R1# show running-config ! lines omitted for brevity interface Serial0/0/0 ip address 172.16.4.1 255.255.255.0 clock rate 2000000 ! interface Serial0/0/1 ip address 172.16.5.1 255.255.255.0 clock rate 128000 ! lines omitted for brevity R1# show controllers serial 0/0/1 Interface Serial0 Hardware is PowerQUICC MPC860 DCE V.35, clock rate 128000 idb at 0x8169BB20, driver data structure at 0x816A35E4 ! Lines omitted for brevity NOTE The clock rate command does not allow just any speed to be configured. However, the list of speeds does vary from router to router. Some people confuse the router bandwidth command with the clock rate command. The clock rate command sets the actual Layer 1 speed used on the link, if no CSU/DSU is used, as just described. Conversely, every router interface has a bandwidth setting, either by default or configured. The bandwidth of the interface is the documented speed of the inter- face, which does not have to match the actual Layer 1 speed used on the interface. 398 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide That bandwidth setting does not impact how fast the interface transmits data. Instead, routers use the interface bandwidth setting as both documentation and as input to some other processes. For instance, the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) routing protocols, discussed in the ICND2 part of the CCNA Routing and Switching material, base their routing protocol metrics on the band- width by default. Example 17-5 highlights the bandwidth setting on Router R1’s S0/0/1 interface, as config- ured in the previous example. In that previous example, the clock rate 128000 command sets the clock rate to 128 kbps, but it leaves the bandwidth command unset. As a result, IOS uses the default serial bandwidth setting of 1544, which means 1544 kbps—which is the speed of a T1 serial link. Example 17-5 Router Bandwidth Settings R1# show interfaces s0/0/1 Serial0/0/1 is up, line protocol is up Hardware is WIC MBRD Serial Description: link to R3 Internet address is 10.1.13.1/24 MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 Kbit/sec, DLY 20000 usec, reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255 Encapsulation HDLC, loopback not set The common mistake people make is to know about clock rate, but mistakenly think that the bandwidth setting is just another term for “clock rate.” It is not. Follow these rules to find these two interface settings: To see the clock rate, look for the clock rate interface subcommand in the configuration, or use the show controllers serial type number command (as shown in Example 17-4.) To see the bandwidth setting on an interface, look for the bandwidth interface subcom- mand in the configuration, or use the show interfaces [type number] command (as shown in Example 17-5). Note that using default bandwidth settings on most router interfaces makes sense, with the exception of serial interfaces. IOS defaults to a bandwidth of 1544 (meaning 1544 kbps, or 1.544 Mbps) for serial interfaces, regardless of the speed dictated by the provider or by a clock rate command in the lab. Most engineers set the bandwidth to match the actual speed, for example, using the bandwidth 128 interface subcommand on a link running at 128 kbps. On Ethernet 10/100 or 10/100/1000 interfaces, the router knows the speed used, and dynamically sets the Ethernet interface’s bandwidth to match. Router Auxiliary Port Both routers and switches have a console port to allow administrative access, but most Cisco routers have an extra physical port called an auxiliary (Aux) port. The Aux port typi- cally serves as a means to make a phone call to connect into the router to issue commands from the CLI. Chapter 17: Operating Cisco Routers 399 17 The Aux port works like the console port, except that the Aux port is typically connected through a cable to an external analog modem, which in turn connects to a phone line. Then, the engineer uses a PC, terminal emulator, and modem to call the remote router. After being connected, the engineer can use the terminal emulator to access the router CLI, starting in user mode as usual. Aux ports can be configured beginning with the line aux 0 command to reach aux line configuration mode. From there, all the commands for the console line, covered mostly in Chapter 8, “Configuring Basic Switch Management,” can be used. For example, the login and password password subcommands on the aux line could be used to set up simple pass- word checking when a user dials in.

That simple statement actually carries a lot of hidden meaning. For routers to route packets, routers follow a routing process. That routing process relies on information called IP routes. Each IP route lists a destination—an IP network, IP subnet, or some other group of IP addresses. Each route also lists instructions that tell the router where to forward packets sent to addresses in that IP network or subnet. For routers to do a good job of routing packets, routers need to have a detailed, accurate list of IP routes. Routers use three methods to add IPv4 routes to their IPv4 routing tables. Routers first learn connected routes, which are routes for subnets attached to a router interface. Routers can also use static routes, which are routes created through a configuration command (ip route) that tells the router what route to put in the IPv4 routing table. And routers can use a routing protocol, in which routers tell each other about all their known routes, so that all routers can learn and build routes to all networks and subnets. This chapter begins by reintroducing the IP routing process that relies on these routes. This IP routing discussion both reviews the concepts from Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4 Addressing and Routing,” plus takes the concepts deeper, including showing information needed in a single IP route. Then, the second major heading in this chapter discusses con- nected routes, including variations of connected routes to VLANs connected to a router’s VLAN trunk, and for connected routes on Layer 3 switches. The final major section then looks at static routes, which let the engineer tell the router what route(s) to add to the router’s IP routing table. The static route section also shows how to configure a static default route that is used when no other route matches an IP packet. Dynamic routing, using the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), awaits in Chapter 19, “Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2.” “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz Take the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Foundation Topics IP Routing IP routing—the process of forwarding IP packets—delivers packets across entire TCP/IP networks, from the device that originally builds the IP packet to the device that is supposed to receive the packet. In other words, IP routing delivers IP packets from the sending host to the destination host. The complete end-to-end routing process relies on network layer logic on hosts and on routers. The sending host uses Layer 3 concepts to create an IP packet, forwarding the IP packet to the host’s default gateway (default router). The process requires Layer 3 logic on the routers as well, by which the routers compare the destination address in the packet to their routing tables, to decide where to forward the IP packet next. The routing process also relies on data-link and physical details at each link. IP routing relies on serial links, Ethernet LANs, wireless LANs, and many other networks that implement data link and physical layer standards. These lower-layer devices and protocols move the IP packets around the TCP/IP network by encapsulating and transmitting the packets inside data link layer frames. Those previous two paragraphs summarize the key concepts about IP routing as introduced back in Chapter 4. Next, this section reviews IP routing, while taking the discussion another step or two deeper, taking advantage of the additional depth of knowledge discussed in Parts II and III of this book. NOTE Some references also incorrectly claim that the term IP routing includes the func- tion of dynamically learning routes with IP routing protocols. IP routing protocols play an important role, but the term IP routing refers to the packet-forwarding process only. IPv4 Routing Process Reference Because you have already seen the basics back in Chapter 4, this section collects the routing process into steps for reference. The steps use many specific terms discussed in Parts II and III of this book. The upcoming descriptions and example then discuss these summaries of routing logic to make sure that each step is clear. 406 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide The routing process starts with the host that creates the IP packet. First, the host asks the question: Is the destination IP address of this new packet in my local subnet? The host uses its own IP address/mask to determine the range of addresses in the local subnet. Based on its own opinion of the range of addresses in the local subnet, a LAN-based host acts as follows: Step 1. If the destination is local, send directly: A. Find the destination host’s MAC address. Use the already-known Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table entry, or use ARP messages to learn the information. B. Encapsulate the IP packet in a data-link frame, with the destination data- link address of the destination host. Step 2. If the destination is not local, send to the default gateway: A. Find the default gateway’s MAC address. Use the already-known Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table entry, or use ARP messages to learn the information. B. Encapsulate the IP packet in a data-link frame, with the destination data- link address of the default gateway. Figure 18-1 summarizes these same concepts. In the figure, host A sends a local packet directly to host D. However, for packets to host B, on the other side of a router and there- fore in a different subnet, host A sends the packet to its default router (R1). (As a reminder, the terms default gateway and default router are synonyms.)

While the host logic began with an IP packet sitting in memory, a router has some work to do before getting to that point. With the following five-step summary of a router’s routing logic, the router takes the first two steps just to receive the frame and extract the IP packet, before thinking about the packet’s destination address at Step 3. The steps are as follows: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz: 1 B 2 A, C 3 A, F 4 C 5 C 6 A 7 B Chapter 18: Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes 407 18 1. For each received data-link frame, choose whether or not to process the frame. Process it if A. The frame has no errors (per the data-link trailer Frame Check Sequence [FCS] field). B. The frame’s destination data-link address is the router’s address (or an appropriate multicast or broadcast address). 2. If choosing to process the frame at Step 1, de-encapsulate the packet from inside the data-link frame. 3. Make a routing decision. To do so, compare the packet’s destination IP address to the routing table and find the route that matches the destination address. This route iden- tifies the outgoing interface of the router and possibly the next-hop router. 4. Encapsulate the packet into a data-link frame appropriate for the outgoing interface. When forwarding out LAN interfaces, use ARP as needed to find the next device’s MAC address. 5. Transmit the frame out the outgoing interface, as listed in the matched IP route. This routing process summary lists many details, but sometimes you can think about the routing process in simpler terms. For example, leaving out some details, this paraphrase of the step list details the same big concepts: The router receives a frame, removes the packet from inside the frame, decides where to forward the packet, puts the packet into another frame, and sends the frame. To give you a little more perspective on these steps, Figure 18-2 breaks down the same five- step routing process as a diagram. T he figure shows a packet arriving from the left, entering a router Ethernet interface, with an IP destination of host C. The figure shows the packet arriving, encapsulated inside an Ethernet frame (both header and trailer).

Router R1 notes that the received Ethernet frame passes the FCS check, and that the destination Ethernet MAC address is R1’s MAC address, so R1 processes the frame. 2. R1 de-encapsulates the IP packet from inside the Ethernet frame’s header and trailer. 3. R1 compares the IP packet’s destination IP address to R1’s IP routing table. 4. R1 encapsulates the IP packet inside a new data-link frame, in this case, inside a High- Level Data Link Control (HDLC) header and trailer. 5. R1 transmits the IP packet, inside the new HDLC frame, out the serial link on the right. NOTE This chapter uses several figures that show an IP packet encapsulated inside a data link layer frame. These figures often show both the data-link header as well as the data-link trailer, with the IP packet in the middle. The IP packets all include the IP header, plus any encapsulated data. An Example of IP Routing The next several pages walk you through an example that discusses each routing step, in order, through multiple devices. That example uses a case in which host A (172.16.1.9) sends a packet to host B (172.16.2.9), with host routing logic and the five steps showing how R1 forwards the packet. Figure 18-3 shows a typical IP addressing diagram for an IPv4 network with typical address abbreviations. The diagram can get a little too messy if it lists the full IP address for every router interface. When possible, these diagrams usually list the subnet, and then the last octet or two of the individual IP addresses—just enough so that you know the IP address, but with less clutter. For example, host A uses IP address 172.16.1.9, taking from subnet 172.16.1.0/24 (in which all addresses begin 172.16.1), and the .9 beside the host A icon. As another example, R1 uses address 172.16.1.1 on its LAN interface, 172.16.4.1 on one serial interface, and 172.16.5.1 on the other serial interface.

Chapter 18: Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes 409 18 Host Forwards the IP Packet to the Default Router (Gateway) In this example, host A uses some application that sends data to host B (172.16.2.9). After host A has the IP packet sitting in memory, host A’s logic reduces to the following: ■ My IP address/mask is 172.16.1.9/24, so my local subnet contains numbers 172.16.1.0–172.16.1.255 (including the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address). ■ The destination address is 172.16.2.9, which is clearly not in my local subnet. ■ Send the packet to my default gateway, which is set to 172.16.1.1. ■ To send the packet, encapsulate it in an Ethernet frame. Make the destination MAC address be R1’s G0/0 MAC address (host A’s default gateway). Figure 18-4 pulls these concepts together, showing the destination IP address and destina- tion MAC address in the frame and packet sent by host A in this case. Note that the figure uses a common drawing convention in networking, showing an Ethernet as a few lines, hid- ing all the detail of the Layer 2 switches.

However, a router can and should ignore some of those frames. So, the first step in the routing pro- cess begins with a decision of whether a router should process the frame or silently dis- card (ignore) the frame. First, the router does a simple but important check (Step 1A in the process summary) so that the router ignores all frames that had bit errors during transmission. The router uses the data-link trailer’s FCS field to check the frame, and if errors occurred in transmission, the router discards the frame. (The router makes no attempt at error recovery; that is, the router does not ask the sender to retransmit the data.) The router also checks the destination data-link address (Step 1B in the summary) to decide whether the frame is intended for the router. For example, frames sent to the router’s uni- cast MAC address for that interface are clearly sent to that router. However, a router can actually receive a frame sent to some other unicast MAC address, and routers should ignore these frames. For example, routers will receive some unicast frames sent to other devices in the VLAN just because of how LAN switches work. Think back to how LAN switches forward unknown unicast frames: frames for which the switch does not list the destination MAC address in the MAC address table. The LAN switch floods those frames. The result? Routers sometimes receive frames destined for some other device, with some other device’s MAC address listed as the destination MAC address. Routers should ignore those frames. 410 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide In this example, host A sends a frame destined for R1’s MAC address. So, after the frame is received, and after R1 confirms with the FCS that no errors occurred, R1 confirms that the frame is destined for R1’s MAC address (0200.0101.0101 in this case). All checks have been passed, so R1 will process the frame, as shown in Figure 18-5. (Note that the large rectangle in the figure represents the internals of Router R1.) 0200.0101.0101 Is this my G0/0 MAC? FCS: Is this frame unchanged?

In router memory, the router no longer needs the original frame’s data-link header and trailer, so the router removes and discards them, leaving the IP packet, as shown in Figure 18-6. Note that the destination IP address remains unchanged (172.16.2.9).

At this point, the router needs to make a choice about where to forward the packet next. That process uses the router’s IP routing table, with some matching logic to compare the packet’s destination address with the table. First, an IP routing table lists multiple routes. Each individual route contains several facts, which in turn can be grouped as shown in Figure 18-7. Part of each route is used to match the destination address of the packet, while the rest of the route lists forwarding instruc- tions: where to send the packet next. Chapter 18: Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes 411 18 IP S0/0/0 Router R1 S0/0/1 172.16.2.0 Subnet Mask Next Router Matching 172.16.2.9 IPv4 Routing Table Forwarding Out Interface 172.16.4.0 172.16.3.0 172.16.1.0 172.16.5.0 172.16.5.3 172.16.4.2 G0/0None None None S0/0/0 S0/0/1 S0/0/0 S0/0/1 /24 /24 /24 /24 /24 G0/0 IP Packet Figure 18-7 Routing Step 3 on Router R1: Matching the Routing Table Focus on the entire routing table for a moment, and notice the fact that it lists five routes. Earlier, Figure 18-3 showed the entire example network, with five subnets, so R1 has a route for each of the five subnets. Next, look at the part of the five routes that Router R1 will use to match packets. To fully define each subnet, each route lists both the subnet ID and the subnet mask. When match- ing the IP packet’s destination with the routing table, the router looks at the packet’s des- tination IP address (172.16.2.9) and compares it to the range of addresses defined by each subnet. Specifically, the router looks at the subnet and mask information, which with a little math, the router can figure out in which of those subnets 172.16.2.9 resides (the route for subnet 172.16.2.0/24). Finally, look to the right side of the figure, to the forwarding instructions for these five routes. After the router matches a specific route, the router uses the forwarding information in the route to tell the router where to send the packet next. In this case, the router matched the route for subnet 172.16.2.0/24, so R1 will forward the packet out its own interface S0/0/0, to Router R2 next, listed with its next-hop router IP address of 172.16.4.2. NOTE Routes for remote subnets typically list both an outgoing interface and next-hop router IP address. Routes for subnets that connect directly to the router list only the out- going interface, because packets to these destinations do not need to be sent to another router. Routing Step 4: Encapsulating the Packet in a New Frame At this point, the router knows how it will forward the packet. However, routers cannot for- ward a packet without first wrapping a data-link header and trailer around it (encapsulation). Encapsulating packets for serial links does not require a lot of thought, because of the simplicity of the HDLC and PPP protocols. As discussed back in Chapter 3, “Fundamentals of WANs,” because serial links have only two devices on the link—the sender and the then-obvious receiver; the data-link addressing does not matter. In this example, R1 forwards the packet out S0/0/0, after encapsulating the packet inside an HDLC frame, as shown in Figure 18-8. 412 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide HDLC HDLCIP IP To: 172.16.2.9 S0/0/0 Router R1 S0/0/1 G0/0 HDLC HDLCIP Packet IP Packet Figure 18-8 Routing Step 4 on Router R1: Encapsulating the Packet Note that with some other types of data links, the router has a little more work to do at this routing step. For example, sometimes a router forwards packets out an Ethernet interface. To encapsulate the IP packet, the router would need to build an Ethernet header, and that Ethernet header’s destination MAC address would need to list the correct value. For example, consider this different sample network, with an Ethernet WAN link between Routers R1 and R2. R1 matches a route that tells R1 to forward the packet out R1’s G0/1 Ethernet interface to 172.16.6.2 (R2) next. R1 needs to put R2’s MAC address in the header, and to do that, R1 uses its IP ARP table information, as shown in Figure 18-9. If R1 did not have an ARP table entry for 172.16.6.2, R1 would first have to use ARP to learn the match- ing MAC address.

The router might have to wait, particularly if other frames are already waiting their turn to exit the interface. Configuring IP Addresses and Connected Routes Cisco routers enable IPv4 routing globally, by default. Then, to make the router be ready to route packets on a particular interface, the interface must be configured with an IP address and the interface must be configured such that it comes up, reaching a “line status up, line protocol up” state. Only at that point can routers route IP packets in and out a particular interface. After a router can route IP packets out one or more interfaces, the router needs some routes. Routers can add routes to their routing tables through three methods: Chapter 18: Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes 413 18 Connected routes: Added because of the configuration of the ip address interface sub- command on the local router Static routes: Added because of the configuration of the ip route global command on the local router Routing protocols: Added as a function by configuration on all routers, resulting in a process by which routers dynamically tell each other about the network so that they all learn routes This second of three sections discusses several variations on how to configure connected routes, while the last major section discusses static routes. Connected Routes and the ip address Command A Cisco router automatically adds a route to its routing table for the subnet connected to each interface, assuming that the f ollowing two facts are true: ■ The interface is in a working state. In other words, the interface status in the show interfaces command lists a line status of up and a protocol status of up. ■ The interface has an IP address assigned through the ip address interface subcommand. The concept of connected routes is relatively basic. The router of course needs to know the subnet number connected to each of its interfaces, so the router can route packets to that subnet. The router does the math, taking the interface IP address and mask, and calculat- ing the subnet ID. However, the router only needs that route when the interface is up and working, so the router includes a connected route in the routing table only when the inter- face is working. Example 18-1 shows the connected routes on Router R1 in Figure 18-10. The first part of the example shows the configuration of IP addresses on all three of R1’s interfaces. The end of the examples lists the output from the show ip route command, which lists these routes with a c as the route code, meaning connected.

Each lists a C in the first column, and each has text that says “directly con- nected”; both identify the route as connected to the router. The early part of each route lists the matching parameters (subnet ID and mask), as shown in the earlier example in Figure 18-7. The end of each of these routes lists the outgoing interface. Note that the router also automatically produces a different kind of route, called a local route. The local routes define a route for the one specific IP address configured on the router interface. Each local route has a /32 prefix length, defining a host route, which defines a route just for that one IP address. For example, the last local route, for 172.16.5.1/32, defines a route that matches only the IP address of 172.16.5.1. Routers use these local routes that list their own local IP addresses to more efficiently forward packets sent to the router itself. Chapter 18: Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes 415 18 The ARP Table on a Cisco Router After a router has added these connected routes, the router can route IPv4 packets between those subnets. To do so, the router makes use of its IP ARP table. The IPv4 ARP table lists the IPv4 address and matching MAC address of hosts connected to the same subnet as the router. When forwarding a packet to a host on the same subnet, the router encapsulates the packet, with a destination MAC address as found in the ARP table. If the router wants to forward a packet to an IP address on the same subnet as the router, but does not find an ARP table entry for that IP address, the router will use ARP messages to learn that device’s MAC address. Example 18-2 shows R1’s ARP table based on the previous example. The output lists R1’s own IP address of 172.16.1.1, with an age of -, meaning that this entry does not time out. Dynamically learned ARP table entries have an upward counter, like the 35-minute value for the ARP table entry for IP address 172.16.1.9. By default, IOS will timeout (remove) an ARP table entry after 240 minutes in which the entry is not used. (IOS resets the timer to 0 when an ARP table entry is used.) Note that to experiment in lab, you might want to empty all dynamic entries (or a single entry for one IP address) using the clear ip arp [ip-address] EXEC command. Example 18-2 Displaying a Router’s IP ARP Table R2# show ip arp Protocol Address Age (min) Hardware Addr Type Interface Internet 172.16.1.1 - 0200.2222.2222 ARPA GigabitEthernet0/0 Internet 172.16.1.9 35 0200.3333.3333 ARPA GigabitEthernet0/0 Thinking about how Router R1 forwards a packet to host A (172.16.1.9), over that final sub- net, R1 does the following: 1. R1 looks in its ARP table for an entry for 172.16.1.9. 2. R1 encapsulates the IP packet in an Ethernet frame, adding destination 0200.3333.3333 to the Ethernet header (as taken from the ARP table). 3. R1 transmits the frame out interface G0/0. Routing Between Subnets on VLANs Almost all enterprise networks use VLANs. To route IP packets in and out of those VLANs—or more accurately, the subnets that sit on each of those VLANs—some router needs to have an IP address in each subnet and have a connected route to each of those sub- nets. Then the hosts in each subnet can use the router IP addresses as their default gateways, respectively. Three options exist for connecting a router to each subnet on a VLAN. However, the first option requires too many interfaces and links, and is only mentioned to make the list complete: ■ Use a router, with one router LAN interface and cable connected to the switch for each and every VLAN (typically not used). ■ Use a router, with a VLAN trunk connecting to a LAN switch. ■ Use a Layer 3 switch. 416 CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide Figure 18-11 shows an example network where the second and third options both happen to be used. The figure shows a central site campus LAN on the left, with 12 VLANs. At the central site, two of the switches act as Layer 3 switches, combining the functions of a router and a switch, routing between all 12 subnets/VLANs. The remote branch sites on the right side of the figure each use two VLANs; each router uses a VLAN trunk to connect to and route for both VLANs. 2 VLANs Layer 3 Switches VLAN Trunking 12 VLANs B1 Core 2 VLANs B2 2 VLANs B3 SW1 D A BC SW2 SW3 Figure 18-11 Layer 3 Switching at the Central Site Note that Figure 18-11 just shows an example.
