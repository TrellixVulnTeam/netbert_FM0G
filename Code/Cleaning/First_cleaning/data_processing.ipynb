      "Isolate Point(s) of Failure.\n",
      "Apply Tools to Determine the Problem's Root Cause.\n",
      "Gather Information on the Problem In a IP telephony network, problems are typically discovered and reported by one of the following types of users: External users trying to reach employees within your company Internal users using phones to call employees in other company locations or PSTN destinations, and perform basic actions such as call transfers and dialing into conferences.\n",
      "As the network administrator, you must collect sufficient information from these users to allow you to isolate the problem.\n",
      "Detailed, accurate information will make this task easier.\n",
      "Table4-3 lists recommended questions to ask users when they report a problem.\n",
      "As you turn up your network, you may consider putting these questions in an on-line form.\n",
      "A form will encourage users to provide more details about the problem and also put them into the habit of looking for particular error messages and indicators.\n",
      "Capturing the information electronically will also permit you to retrieve and re-examine this information in the future, should the problem repeat itself.\n",
      "Table4-3 Questions to Ask Users When They Report Problems Ask this Question... To Determine... Did something fail or did it simply perform poorly?\n",
      "Whether the issue relates to system degradation or a connectivity failure.\n",
      "An example of a failure is when a user dials a phone number and hears fast busy tone.\n",
      "An example of a performance problem is when a user dials into a conference call and hears \"choppy\" audio when other parties speak.\n",
      "Quality of service or performance issues require a different approach than connectivity or operational problems.\n",
      "You must still isolate the potential sources of the problem, but you will typically use performance management tools instead of log files.\n",
      "What device were you trying to use?\n",
      "The device type, model and version of software installed.\n",
      "It is also critical to capture the IP address assigned to the device, as well as its MAC address.\n",
      "If the case of IP phones, determining the phone's active Cisco Unified Communications Manager server is also important.\n",
      "On Cisco Unified IP phones, these important network values can be displayed by pressing the Settings button and choosing the Network Configuration option from the menu.\n",
      "4-13 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter4 Implement Introduction to Troubleshooting Did it ever work?\n",
      "If a device was recently installed and the problem occurred while making it work for the first time, or if the device was operating normally before the problem occurred.\n",
      "If the device was newly installed, the problem is most likely due to improper configuration or wiring of that particular device.\n",
      "Problems with devices that are already up and running can typically be traced back to one of two causes: (a) the user modifying their device, such as changing their configuration or upgrading software, or (b) a change or failure elsewhere in the network.\n",
      "Exactly what action(s) did you perform?\n",
      "The steps that led up to the problem, including which buttons were pressed and in which order.\n",
      "Capturing this information in detail is important so that you can consistently reproduce the problem.\n",
      "What error message(s) appeared or announcements did you hear?\n",
      "The visual and audio indicators of the problem.\n",
      "Ask users to provide the exact text that appears and any error codes in either an E-mail or on-line form.\n",
      "If the error indication was audible, ask the user to write down the announcement they heard, the last menu option they were able to successfully choose or the tone they heard when the call failed.\n",
      "What time did the problem occur?\n",
      "The date and time to compare against entries in log files.\n",
      "If the problem occurred on a Cisco Unified IP phone, make certain the user provides the timestamp that appears on their phone's display.\n",
      "Several Cisco components in a network may capture the same problem event in separate log files, with different ID values.\n",
      "In order to correlate log entries written by different components, you must compare the timestamps to find messages for the same event.\n",
      "Cisco Unified IP phones synchronize their date and time with their active Cisco Unified Communications Manager server.\n",
      "If all Cisco components in the network use Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize with the same source, then the timestamps for the same problem messages will match in every log file.\n",
      "What is the number of the phone you used and what was the phone number you called?\n",
      "If the problem relates to a WAN or PTSN link, or a Cisco Unified Communications Manager dial plan issue.\n",
      "Ask the user the phone number he or she dialed (called number) and determine if the destination was within his or her site, another site within the corporate network, or a PSTN destination.\n",
      "Because the calling number (the number of the phone used) also affects call routing in some cases, capture this number as well.\n",
      "Table4-3 Questions to Ask Users When They Report Problems (continued) Ask this Question... To Determine... 4-14 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter4 Implement Introduction to Troubleshooting Isolate Point(s) of Failure After collecting information on the symptoms and behavior of the problem, to narrow the focus of your efforts you should: Identify the specific devices involved in the problem.\n",
      "Check the version of software running on each device.\n",
      "Determine if something has changed in the network.\n",
      "Verify the integrity of the IP network.\n",
      "Identify Devices Involved in the Problem In large- to medium-sized networks, it is crucial to identify the specific phones, routers, switches, servers and other devices that were involved in a reported problem.\n",
      "Isolating these devices allows you to rule out the vast majority of equipment within the network and focus your time and energy on suspect devices.\n",
      "To help you isolate which devices were involved in a problem, two types of information can prove invaluable: Network topology diagrams: It is strongly recommended that you have one or more diagrams that show the arrangement of all Cisco Unified Communications products in your network.\n",
      "These diagrams illustrate how these devices are connected and also capture each device's IP address and name (you may want to also have a spreadsheet or database of the latter information).\n",
      "This information can help you visualize the situation and focus on the devices that may be contributing to the reported problem.\n",
      "See Network Topology Diagrams for recommendations on how to prepare these diagrams.\n",
      "Call flow diagrams: Cisco equipment, including Unified Communications Manager servers, typically provide detailed debug and call trace log files.\n",
      "To interpret these log files, however, it is useful to understand the signaling that occurs between devices as calls are set up and disconnected.\n",
      "Using the network topology and call flow diagrams in conjunction with the log files, you can trace how far a call progressed before it failed and identify which device reported the problem.\n",
      "Examples of using call flow diagrams for problem isolation are shown in Troubleshooting Daily Operations.\n",
      "Did you try to perform any special actions, such as a transfer, forward, call park, call pickup, or meet-me conference?\n",
      "Is the phone set up to automatically perform any of these actions?\n",
      "If the problem is not directly related to the calling number or called number but rather to the supplementary service setup on Unified Communications Manager or the problem is at the destination phone the user tried to reach by transferring or forwarding the call.\n",
      "Did you attempt the same action on another device?\n",
      "If the problem is isolated to that user's device or represents a more widespread network problem.\n",
      "If the user cannot make a call from his or her phone, ask the user to place a call to the same destination using a phone in a nearby office.\n",
      "Table4-3 Questions to Ask Users When They Report Problems (continued) Ask this Question... To Determine... 4-15 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter4 Implement Introduction to Troubleshooting Check Software Release Versions for Compatibility After you have identified which devices may be involved in the problem, verify that the version of software running on each device is compatible with the software running on every other device.\n",
      "As part of Cisco Unified Communications Release6.0(1) verification, Cisco Systems has performed interoperability and load testing on simulated network environments running specific software versions.\n",
      "The Release Matrix lists the combination of software releases that were tested.\n",
      "However, if the combination of releases installed in your network does not match the values in the Release Matrix, it does not necessarily mean the combination is invalid.\n",
      "To check interoperability for a specific device and software release, locate and review its Release Notes.\n",
      "Release Notes contain up-to-date information on compatibility between the product and various releases of other products.\n",
      "This document also describes open caveats, known issues that may cause unexpected behavior.\n",
      "Before beginning extensive troubleshooting work, examine the Release Notes to determine if you are experiencing a known problem that has an available workaround.\n",
      "Tip The Bug Toolkit requires that you are a Cisco partner or a registered Cisco.com user with a Cisco service contract.\n",
      "Using the Bug Toolkit, you can find caveats for any release.\n",
      "To access the Bug Toolkit, go to http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl .\n",
      "Determine if Network Changes Have Occurred Before focusing on the particular device or site where the problem occurred, it may be useful to determine if a change was made to surrounding devices.\n",
      "If something has been added, reconfigured or removed from elsewhere in the network, that change may be the source of the problem.\n",
      "It is recommended that you track changes to the IP telephony network such as: New user phones added Modifications to Cisco Unified Communications Manager call routing settings, such as new directory numbers, route patterns and dial rules to support new sites or devices Changes to port configurations on switches, routers or gateways (new equipment, wiring changes or new port activation) Changes to IP addressing schemes (such as adding new subnets) that may have affected route tables Verify the IP Network Integrity Always remember that Cisco Unified Communications equipment relies on a backbone IP network.\n",
      "Many connectivity problems are not caused by configuration errors or operational failures on Cisco devices, but rather by the IP network that interconnects them.\n",
      "Problems such as poor voice quality are typically due to IP network congestion, while call failures between locations may be the result of network outages due to disconnected cables or improperly configured IP route tables.\n",
      "Before assuming that call processing problems result from Cisco Unified Communications devices themselves, check the integrity of the backbone IP network.\n",
      "Keep the OSI model in mind as you perform these checks.\n",
      "Start from the bottom, at the physical layer, by checking that end-to-end cabling.\n",
      "Then verify the status of Layer 2 switches, looking for any port errors.\n",
      "Move from there to confirm that the Layer 3 routers are running and contain correct routing tables.\n",
      "Continue up the OSI stack to Layer 7, the application layer.\n",
      "To resolve problems occurring at the top levels of the stack, a protocol analyzer (or \"sniffer\") may be useful.\n",
      "You can use sniffer to examine the IP traffic passing between devices and also decode the packets.\n",
      "Sniffers are particularly useful for troubleshooting errors between devices that communicate using Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n",

      "For detailed Cisco IP telephony feature information, see the System Release Notes for IP Telephony: Cisco Unified Communications System, Release 6.0(1).\n",
      "Additional Product Information Cisco Unified IP Telephony Solution Planning Concepts This topic presents planning concepts.\n",
      "It is assumed that your network will be a converged network that combines voice, data, and video and that you have decided on one of network types discussed in the Internetwork Design Guide.\n",
      "You should also review the information contained in the Market Descriptions topic.\n",
      "The primary planning considerations that drive the planning stage are: types of deployment, whether it will be a new installation or migration to new installation with existing equipment; application availability based on your networking needs for multimedia and voice, security, redundancy, fault tolerance, and the costs associated with your needs.\n",
      "Your goal is to minimize costs while delivering service that does not compromise established availability and performance requirements.\n",
      "These issues are essentially at odds.\n",
      "Any increase in availability and performance must generally be reflected as an increase in cost.\n",
      "As a result, you must carefully weigh the relative importance of resource availability, performance constraints, variables, and overall cost.\n",
      "Note The concepts discussed in this topic are meant to be a high-level overview of considerations and not meant to be a definitive set of rules.\n",
      "The concepts that you should review are as follows: Deployment Types Cost of Ownership Redundancy Capacity and QoS Security Deployment Types The deployment types to consider are as follows: New Installation – Greenfield—Completely new installation of the Cisco Unified Communications system, using no existing equipment.\n",
      "2-15 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter2 Prepare and Plan Planning Concepts – Legacy—New installation of the Cisco Unified Communications system combined with existing legacy equipment, such as TDM PBXs and third-party adjuncts, which may require long-term co-existence and integration or eventual migration to the new installation.\n",
      "Brownfield—Existing Cisco Unified Communications system, which requires an upgrade and migration from a previous system release to the current system release.\n",
      "Single-Stage Upgrade – Using existing hardware—All components in the network start at the base release set and all components can be upgraded to the target release set within a single maintenance window.\n",
      "Using new hardware (flash-cut or shrink-and-grow)—A parallel network should be built using new hardware and pre-staged with configuration to support the existing production network.\n",
      "Multistage System Upgrade – Using existing hardware (hybrid system)—The components in individual sites can be upgraded from the base release set to the target release set in stages, during separate maintenance windows.\n",
      "Multisite Migration with Independent Site Upgrade – Using an hybrid network with interworking release sets—Components are upgraded on a site-by-site basis during separate maintenance windows.\n",
      "At the completion of each maintenance window, a hybrid network exists within the multiple sites that have components operating on the base release set; or components that are operating on the target release set; or components that are a hybrid system as described in Multistage System Upgrade.\n",
      "For more information about deployment types, see the System Installation and Upgrade for IP Telephony: Cisco Unified Communications System.\n",
      "Cost of Ownership Information system budgets can run into millions of dollars.\n",
      "As large organizations increasingly rely on electronic data for managing business activities, the associated costs of computing resources continue to rise.\n",
      "With this in mind, your basic network plan should include the following: Environmental consideration—Include the location of hosts, servers, terminals, and other end nodes; the projected traffic for the environment; and the projected costs for delivering different service levels.\n",
      "Performance constraints—Consider network reliability, traffic throughput, and host and client computer speeds.\n",
      "For example, network interface cards and hard drive access speeds.\n",
      "Internetworking variables—Include the network topology, line capacities, packet flow assignments, redundancy and fault tolerance factors, backward compatibility (co-existence and interoperability), and security.\n",
      "Redundancy Redundancy is critical considering the number of vital business applications running on the network.\n",
      "If you have a distributed network with several access layers to remote offices, and you have a failure from the distribution layer to the core without redundancy, you have loss of network service for a large number of people.\n",
      "If you have redundancy in the distribution layer and the core, you can potentially lose one or more circuits without disturbing service to any particular group of users.\n",
      "Depending on the application, you may also need some redundancy from the access layer to the distribution layer.\n",
      "2-16 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter2 Prepare and Plan Planning Concepts Because of redundancy, if you drop a link at any one point in the network, every remote group or user still has a path to get back to the core.\n",
      "Even if you cut off the connection from one of the distribution switches back to the core, you still have access to the core for every user.\n",
      "For more information on redundancy planning, see the Redundancy and Load Sharing Design Guide.\n",
      "Capacity and QoS Capacity and QoS are major considerations in a converged network and effect one another.\n",
      "QoS is needed to prevent applications from using more than a fair share of bandwidth and degrading the performance of other applications.\n",
      "At the WAN interface, QoS is needed to allocate expensive wide area capacity among applications.\n",
      "Bandwidth and QoS requirements are easy to figure in a multilayered design because the traffic flow is fairly predictable.\n",
      "You can also have end-to-end QoS in a multilayered design.\n",
      "End-to-end QoS is critical when you have real-time applications, such as a voice conversation or video presentation, and you have non-real time applications that can interfere with the real-time applications.\n",
      "For example, if the real-time and non-real time applications arrive at the same layer at the same time, the network must pass the real-time packets first, as well as keep latency and jitter low.\n",
      "QoS end-to-end is the answer.\n",
      "Consider Call Admission Control (CAC) as an alternative to QoS.\n",
      "CAC limits the amount of traffic allowed onto the network at the ingress point.\n",
      "Because you know that the network will be congested at various times during the day, you can disallow additional traffic by using CAC.\n",
      "Also consider using traffic shaping techniques using a traffic shaping devices.\n",
      "A combination of QoS, CAC and traffic shaping will provide optimal performance for applications on a converged network.\n",
      "Managing link speed mismatches is the last element of traffic management.\n",
      "The mismatches, called chokepoints or bottlenecks, are a basic design issue whenever a large capacity link generates traffic destined for a low capacity link.To avoid the mismatches, carefully analyze the traffic and the device capabilities, then upgrade the interface (if needed) and apply a combination of CAC and QoS.\n",
      "For more information on QoS, see the Enterprise QoS Solution Reference Network Design Guide.\n",
      "Security Cisco recommends multiple layers of security technologies to prevent a single configuration error from jeopardizing the security of the network.\n",
      "Cisco also recommends operational processes that ensure prompt application of software patches, timely installation of new security technologies, and performance of regular security audits and assessments.\n",
      "As you begin to design your network, rank the importance of your network assets and services by considering these factors: What keeps you in business?\n",
      "How do you make money?\n",
      "Does loss of data or privacy equal lost money?\n",
      "What about regulatory compliance?\n",
      "How do you protect your critical data?\n",
      "Where does voice fit?\n",
      "Then consider the potential threats to your business, which may include: Toll fraud 2-17 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter2 Prepare and Plan Planning Tasks Eavesdropping Address spoofing Fake caller identity Media tampering Denial of service SPAM, SPIT (SPAM over IP telephony), and SPIM (SPAM over Instant Messaging) In addition to the operational processes, advanced security technologies should be reviewed and considered.\n",

      "The chief components of application availability are response time, throughput, and reliability.\n",
      "You can assess user requirements as follows: – Develop community profiles of what different user groups require.\n",
      "Although many users have roughly the same requirements of an electronic mail system, engineering groups using Windows terminals and Sun workstations in an NFS environment have different needs from PC users sharing print servers in a finance department.\n",
      "Build a baseline for implementing an internetwork by interviewing groups, forming focus groups, or using surveys.\n",
      "Some groups might require access to common servers, while others might want to allow external access to specific internal computing resources.\n",
      "Formal surveys can be used to get a statistically valid reading of user sentiment regarding a particular service level or proposed internetworking architecture.\n",
      "Conduct a test involving representative users in a lab environment.\n",
      "This is most applicable when evaluating response time requirements.\n",

      "For detailed Cisco IP telephony feature information, see the System Release Notes for IP Telephony: Cisco Unified Communications System, Release 6.0(1).\n",
      "Additional Product Information Cisco Unified IP Telephony Solution Planning Concepts This topic presents planning concepts.\n",
      "It is assumed that your network will be a converged network that combines voice, data, and video and that you have decided on one of network types discussed in the Internetwork Design Guide.\n",
      "You should also review the information contained in the Market Descriptions topic.\n",
      "The primary planning considerations that drive the planning stage are: types of deployment, whether it will be a new installation or migration to new installation with existing equipment; application availability based on your networking needs for multimedia and voice, security, redundancy, fault tolerance, and the costs associated with your needs.\n",
      "Your goal is to minimize costs while delivering service that does not compromise established availability and performance requirements.\n",
      "These issues are essentially at odds.\n",
      "Any increase in availability and performance must generally be reflected as an increase in cost.\n",
      "As a result, you must carefully weigh the relative importance of resource availability, performance constraints, variables, and overall cost.\n",
      "Note The concepts discussed in this topic are meant to be a high-level overview of considerations and not meant to be a definitive set of rules.\n",
      "The concepts that you should review are as follows: Deployment Types Cost of Ownership Redundancy Capacity and QoS Security Deployment Types The deployment types to consider are as follows: New Installation – Greenfield—Completely new installation of the Cisco Unified Communications system, using no existing equipment.\n",
      "2-15 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter2 Prepare and Plan Planning Concepts – Legacy—New installation of the Cisco Unified Communications system combined with existing legacy equipment, such as TDM PBXs and third-party adjuncts, which may require long-term co-existence and integration or eventual migration to the new installation.\n",
      "Brownfield—Existing Cisco Unified Communications system, which requires an upgrade and migration from a previous system release to the current system release.\n",
      "Single-Stage Upgrade – Using existing hardware—All components in the network start at the base release set and all components can be upgraded to the target release set within a single maintenance window.\n",
      "Using new hardware (flash-cut or shrink-and-grow)—A parallel network should be built using new hardware and pre-staged with configuration to support the existing production network.\n",
      "Multistage System Upgrade – Using existing hardware (hybrid system)—The components in individual sites can be upgraded from the base release set to the target release set in stages, during separate maintenance windows.\n",
      "Multisite Migration with Independent Site Upgrade – Using an hybrid network with interworking release sets—Components are upgraded on a site-by-site basis during separate maintenance windows.\n",
      "At the completion of each maintenance window, a hybrid network exists within the multiple sites that have components operating on the base release set; or components that are operating on the target release set; or components that are a hybrid system as described in Multistage System Upgrade.\n",
      "For more information about deployment types, see the System Installation and Upgrade for IP Telephony: Cisco Unified Communications System.\n",
      "Cost of Ownership Information system budgets can run into millions of dollars.\n",
      "As large organizations increasingly rely on electronic data for managing business activities, the associated costs of computing resources continue to rise.\n",
      "With this in mind, your basic network plan should include the following: Environmental consideration—Include the location of hosts, servers, terminals, and other end nodes; the projected traffic for the environment; and the projected costs for delivering different service levels.\n",
      "Performance constraints—Consider network reliability, traffic throughput, and host and client computer speeds.\n",
      "For example, network interface cards and hard drive access speeds.\n",
      "Internetworking variables—Include the network topology, line capacities, packet flow assignments, redundancy and fault tolerance factors, backward compatibility (co-existence and interoperability), and security.\n",
      "Redundancy Redundancy is critical considering the number of vital business applications running on the network.\n",
      "If you have a distributed network with several access layers to remote offices, and you have a failure from the distribution layer to the core without redundancy, you have loss of network service for a large number of people.\n",
      "If you have redundancy in the distribution layer and the core, you can potentially lose one or more circuits without disturbing service to any particular group of users.\n",
      "Depending on the application, you may also need some redundancy from the access layer to the distribution layer.\n",
      "2-16 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter2 Prepare and Plan Planning Concepts Because of redundancy, if you drop a link at any one point in the network, every remote group or user still has a path to get back to the core.\n",
      "Even if you cut off the connection from one of the distribution switches back to the core, you still have access to the core for every user.\n",
      "For more information on redundancy planning, see the Redundancy and Load Sharing Design Guide.\n",
      "Capacity and QoS Capacity and QoS are major considerations in a converged network and effect one another.\n",
      "QoS is needed to prevent applications from using more than a fair share of bandwidth and degrading the performance of other applications.\n",
      "At the WAN interface, QoS is needed to allocate expensive wide area capacity among applications.\n",
      "Bandwidth and QoS requirements are easy to figure in a multilayered design because the traffic flow is fairly predictable.\n",
      "You can also have end-to-end QoS in a multilayered design.\n",
      "End-to-end QoS is critical when you have real-time applications, such as a voice conversation or video presentation, and you have non-real time applications that can interfere with the real-time applications.\n",
      "For example, if the real-time and non-real time applications arrive at the same layer at the same time, the network must pass the real-time packets first, as well as keep latency and jitter low.\n",
      "QoS end-to-end is the answer.\n",
      "Consider Call Admission Control (CAC) as an alternative to QoS.\n",
      "CAC limits the amount of traffic allowed onto the network at the ingress point.\n",
      "Because you know that the network will be congested at various times during the day, you can disallow additional traffic by using CAC.\n",
      "Also consider using traffic shaping techniques using a traffic shaping devices.\n",
      "A combination of QoS, CAC and traffic shaping will provide optimal performance for applications on a converged network.\n",
      "Managing link speed mismatches is the last element of traffic management.\n",
      "The mismatches, called chokepoints or bottlenecks, are a basic design issue whenever a large capacity link generates traffic destined for a low capacity link.To avoid the mismatches, carefully analyze the traffic and the device capabilities, then upgrade the interface (if needed) and apply a combination of CAC and QoS.\n",
      "For more information on QoS, see the Enterprise QoS Solution Reference Network Design Guide.\n",
      "Security Cisco recommends multiple layers of security technologies to prevent a single configuration error from jeopardizing the security of the network.\n",
      "Cisco also recommends operational processes that ensure prompt application of software patches, timely installation of new security technologies, and performance of regular security audits and assessments.\n",
      "As you begin to design your network, rank the importance of your network assets and services by considering these factors: What keeps you in business?\n",
      "How do you make money?\n",
      "Does loss of data or privacy equal lost money?\n",
      "What about regulatory compliance?\n",
      "How do you protect your critical data?\n",

      "The chief components of application availability are response time, throughput, and reliability.\n",
      "You can assess user requirements as follows: – Develop community profiles of what different user groups require.\n",
      "Although many users have roughly the same requirements of an electronic mail system, engineering groups using Windows terminals and Sun workstations in an NFS environment have different needs from PC users sharing print servers in a finance department.\n",
      "Build a baseline for implementing an internetwork by interviewing groups, forming focus groups, or using surveys.\n",
      "Some groups might require access to common servers, while others might want to allow external access to specific internal computing resources.\n",
      "Formal surveys can be used to get a statistically valid reading of user sentiment regarding a particular service level or proposed internetworking architecture.\n",
      "Conduct a test involving representative users in a lab environment.\n",
      "This is most applicable when evaluating response time requirements.\n",

      "Isolate Point(s) of Failure.\n",
      "Apply Tools to Determine the Problem's Root Cause.\n",
      "Gather Information on the Problem In a IP telephony network, problems are typically discovered and reported by one of the following types of users: External users trying to reach employees within your company Internal users using phones to call employees in other company locations or PSTN destinations, and perform basic actions such as call transfers and dialing into conferences.\n",
      "As the network administrator, you must collect sufficient information from these users to allow you to isolate the problem.\n",
      "Detailed, accurate information will make this task easier.\n",
      "Table4-3 lists recommended questions to ask users when they report a problem.\n",
      "As you turn up your network, you may consider putting these questions in an on-line form.\n",
      "A form will encourage users to provide more details about the problem and also put them into the habit of looking for particular error messages and indicators.\n",
      "Capturing the information electronically will also permit you to retrieve and re-examine this information in the future, should the problem repeat itself.\n",
      "Table4-3 Questions to Ask Users When They Report Problems Ask this Question... To Determine... Did something fail or did it simply perform poorly?\n",
      "Whether the issue relates to system degradation or a connectivity failure.\n",
      "An example of a failure is when a user dials a phone number and hears fast busy tone.\n",
      "An example of a performance problem is when a user dials into a conference call and hears \"choppy\" audio when other parties speak.\n",
      "Quality of service or performance issues require a different approach than connectivity or operational problems.\n",
      "You must still isolate the potential sources of the problem, but you will typically use performance management tools instead of log files.\n",
      "What device were you trying to use?\n",
      "The device type, model and version of software installed.\n",
      "It is also critical to capture the IP address assigned to the device, as well as its MAC address.\n",
      "If the case of IP phones, determining the phone's active Cisco Unified Communications Manager server is also important.\n",
      "On Cisco Unified IP phones, these important network values can be displayed by pressing the Settings button and choosing the Network Configuration option from the menu.\n",
      "4-13 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter4 Implement Introduction to Troubleshooting Did it ever work?\n",
      "If a device was recently installed and the problem occurred while making it work for the first time, or if the device was operating normally before the problem occurred.\n",
      "If the device was newly installed, the problem is most likely due to improper configuration or wiring of that particular device.\n",
      "Problems with devices that are already up and running can typically be traced back to one of two causes: (a) the user modifying their device, such as changing their configuration or upgrading software, or (b) a change or failure elsewhere in the network.\n",
      "Exactly what action(s) did you perform?\n",
      "The steps that led up to the problem, including which buttons were pressed and in which order.\n",
      "Capturing this information in detail is important so that you can consistently reproduce the problem.\n",
      "What error message(s) appeared or announcements did you hear?\n",
      "The visual and audio indicators of the problem.\n",
      "Ask users to provide the exact text that appears and any error codes in either an E-mail or on-line form.\n",
      "If the error indication was audible, ask the user to write down the announcement they heard, the last menu option they were able to successfully choose or the tone they heard when the call failed.\n",
      "What time did the problem occur?\n",
      "The date and time to compare against entries in log files.\n",
      "If the problem occurred on a Cisco Unified IP phone, make certain the user provides the timestamp that appears on their phone's display.\n",
      "Several Cisco components in a network may capture the same problem event in separate log files, with different ID values.\n",
      "In order to correlate log entries written by different components, you must compare the timestamps to find messages for the same event.\n",
      "Cisco Unified IP phones synchronize their date and time with their active Cisco Unified Communications Manager server.\n",
      "If all Cisco components in the network use Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize with the same source, then the timestamps for the same problem messages will match in every log file.\n",
      "What is the number of the phone you used and what was the phone number you called?\n",
      "If the problem relates to a WAN or PTSN link, or a Cisco Unified Communications Manager dial plan issue.\n",
      "Ask the user the phone number he or she dialed (called number) and determine if the destination was within his or her site, another site within the corporate network, or a PSTN destination.\n",
      "Because the calling number (the number of the phone used) also affects call routing in some cases, capture this number as well.\n",

To Determine... 4-14 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter4 Implement Introduction to Troubleshooting Isolate Point(s) of Failure After collecting information on the symptoms and behavior of the problem, to narrow the focus of your efforts you should: Identify the specific devices involved in the problem.\n",
      "Check the version of software running on each device.\n",
      "Determine if something has changed in the network.\n",
      "Verify the integrity of the IP network.\n",
      "Identify Devices Involved in the Problem In large- to medium-sized networks, it is crucial to identify the specific phones, routers, switches, servers and other devices that were involved in a reported problem.\n",
      "Isolating these devices allows you to rule out the vast majority of equipment within the network and focus your time and energy on suspect devices.\n",
      "To help you isolate which devices were involved in a problem, two types of information can prove invaluable: Network topology diagrams: It is strongly recommended that you have one or more diagrams that show the arrangement of all Cisco Unified Communications products in your network.\n",
      "These diagrams illustrate how these devices are connected and also capture each device's IP address and name (you may want to also have a spreadsheet or database of the latter information).\n",
      "This information can help you visualize the situation and focus on the devices that may be contributing to the reported problem.\n",
      "See Network Topology Diagrams for recommendations on how to prepare these diagrams.\n",
      "Call flow diagrams: Cisco equipment, including Unified Communications Manager servers, typically provide detailed debug and call trace log files.\n",
      "To interpret these log files, however, it is useful to understand the signaling that occurs between devices as calls are set up and disconnected.\n",
      "Using the network topology and call flow diagrams in conjunction with the log files, you can trace how far a call progressed before it failed and identify which device reported the problem.\n",
      "Examples of using call flow diagrams for problem isolation are shown in Troubleshooting Daily Operations.\n",
      "Did you try to perform any special actions, such as a transfer, forward, call park, call pickup, or meet-me conference?\n",
      "Is the phone set up to automatically perform any of these actions?\n",
      "If the problem is not directly related to the calling number or called number but rather to the supplementary service setup on Unified Communications Manager or the problem is at the destination phone the user tried to reach by transferring or forwarding the call.\n",
      "Did you attempt the same action on another device?\n",
      "If the problem is isolated to that user's device or represents a more widespread network problem.\n",
      "If the user cannot make a call from his or her phone, ask the user to place a call to the same destination using a phone in a nearby office.\n",

To Determine... 4-15 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter4 Implement Introduction to Troubleshooting Check Software Release Versions for Compatibility After you have identified which devices may be involved in the problem, verify that the version of software running on each device is compatible with the software running on every other device.\n",
      "As part of Cisco Unified Communications Release6.0(1) verification, Cisco Systems has performed interoperability and load testing on simulated network environments running specific software versions.\n",
      "The Release Matrix lists the combination of software releases that were tested.\n",
      "However, if the combination of releases installed in your network does not match the values in the Release Matrix, it does not necessarily mean the combination is invalid.\n",
      "To check interoperability for a specific device and software release, locate and review its Release Notes.\n",
      "Release Notes contain up-to-date information on compatibility between the product and various releases of other products.\n",
      "This document also describes open caveats, known issues that may cause unexpected behavior.\n",
      "Before beginning extensive troubleshooting work, examine the Release Notes to determine if you are experiencing a known problem that has an available workaround.\n",
      "Tip The Bug Toolkit requires that you are a Cisco partner or a registered Cisco.com user with a Cisco service contract.\n",
      "Using the Bug Toolkit, you can find caveats for any release.\n",
      "To access the Bug Toolkit, go to http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl .\n",
      "Determine if Network Changes Have Occurred Before focusing on the particular device or site where the problem occurred, it may be useful to determine if a change was made to surrounding devices.\n",
      "If something has been added, reconfigured or removed from elsewhere in the network, that change may be the source of the problem.\n",
      "It is recommended that you track changes to the IP telephony network such as: New user phones added Modifications to Cisco Unified Communications Manager call routing settings, such as new directory numbers, route patterns and dial rules to support new sites or devices Changes to port configurations on switches, routers or gateways (new equipment, wiring changes or new port activation) Changes to IP addressing schemes (such as adding new subnets) that may have affected route tables Verify the IP Network Integrity Always remember that Cisco Unified Communications equipment relies on a backbone IP network.\n",
      "Many connectivity problems are not caused by configuration errors or operational failures on Cisco devices, but rather by the IP network that interconnects them.\n",
      "Problems such as poor voice quality are typically due to IP network congestion, while call failures between locations may be the result of network outages due to disconnected cables or improperly configured IP route tables.\n",
      "Before assuming that call processing problems result from Cisco Unified Communications devices themselves, check the integrity of the backbone IP network.\n",
      "Keep the OSI model in mind as you perform these checks.\n",
      "Start from the bottom, at the physical layer, by checking that end-to-end cabling.\n",
      "Then verify the status of Layer 2 switches, looking for any port errors.\n",
      "Move from there to confirm that the Layer 3 routers are running and contain correct routing tables.\n",
      "Continue up the OSI stack to Layer 7, the application layer.\n",
      "To resolve problems occurring at the top levels of the stack, a protocol analyzer (or \"sniffer\") may be useful.\n",
      "You can use sniffer to examine the IP traffic passing between devices and also decode the packets.\n",

      "Tracing can be enabled on multiple devices and the log file output compared to isolate problems.\n",
      "In order to correlate messages for the same activity in different log files, you must compare the message timestamps and the source device MAC and IP addresses (there is no universal call ID value shared between Cisco devices).\n",
      "You should synchronize every device to the same date and time source so that the timestamps match.\n",
      "To accomplish this synchronization, set each device to obtain its date and time from the same Network Time Protocol (NTP) source.\n",
      "For Cisco IOS-based devices (switches, routers or voice gateways), you can configure each device to act as a NTP client and periodically poll a master NTP source using the following command: ntp server ip-address [version number] [key keyid] [source interface] [prefer] Additional IOS commands are available to establish a device as a NTP peer (operating as the master source for other devices), as well as setting up NTP broadcasting instead of polling.\n",

      "Problems described in this section include: One-Way Audio Call Indication Without a Connection Poor Voice Quality One-Way Audio One-way audio and no audio at all (no-way audio) are problems that are fairly common during a new IP telephony network installation.\n",
      "The majority of these problems are caused by misconfigurations.\n",

      "For no audio in either direction, the troubleshooting methodology is the same.\n",
      "You might need to repeat the procedure for each direction of audio, but more likely you will find the source of the problem when trying to troubleshoot one direction.\n",
      "There are several steps you can take to troubleshoot a one-way/no-way audio problem: 1.\n",
      "Verify Bidirectional IP Connectivity.\n",
      "Check Cisco IOS Software Gateway Configurations.\n",
      "5-12 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations 3.\n",
      "Check for NAT or Firewall Restrictions.\n",
      "For additional directions on troubleshooting one-way audio problems, refer to the Troubleshooting One-Way Voice Issues Tech Note .\n",
      "Verify Bidirectional IP Connectivity You should verify IP connectivity as the first step in troubleshooting a one-way or no-way audio problem because IP connectivity must be present for voice packets to be exchanged between two devices.\n",
      "A large number of one-way or no-way audio problems are caused by lack of IP connectivity.\n",
      "Check that: If the two endpoints involved in the call are on different IP subnets, each endpoint has the correct default gateway and subnet mask settings If one of the endpoints is a Unified IP phone, the DHCP scope has an incorrectly configured default gateway parameter.\n",
      "If one of the endpoints is a Cisco IOS software gateway, the default route is correct.\n",
      "Also, ping the other endpoint from the gateway.\n",
      "If the ping is successful, you know that you have IP connectivity.\n",
      "If the ping is unsuccessful, perform a traceroute to determine where the problem lies.\n",
      "Note Remember that signaling packet traffic is always between Unified Communications Manager and the endpoint, whereas the RTP voice packet traffic is directly between the endpoints.\n",
      "So just because the endpoints are registered to Unified Communications Manager and can set up a call through Unified Communications Manager does not mean that the endpoints have proper IP connectivity between them.\n",
      "Another useful tool for troubleshooting such a problem is the help (i or ?)\n",
      "button on Cisco Unified IP phones.\n",
      "Press the help (i or ?)\n",
      "button twice in quick succession during an active call.\n",
      "The display shows you receive and transmit statistics for the call.\n",
      "If you do not see the receive counter (RxCnt) incrementing, the packets are probably not arriving on that IP phone.\n",
      "If you go to the originating IP phone and the transmit count (TxCnt) is incrementing, the packets are probably being lost somewhere in the network.\n",
      "If a ping or traceroute does not provide enough information about where the packets are being lost, you may need to connect a sniffer to the network and perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Connect the sniffer to the back of the originating IP phone and make verify that the phone is actually transmitting packets.\n",
      "On the originating phone, verify that the IP address and MAC address information is correct.\n",
      "If the network settings on the originating phone are correct, go to the terminating IP phone to verify that the packets are not arriving.\n",
      "If the voice packets are not arriving at the terminating phone, move the sniffer from network hop to network hop to isolate where the packets are being dropped.\n",
      "A common reason for a problem such as this is a missing or improperly configured IP route.\n",
      "Check Cisco IOS Software Gateway Configurations There are various reasons why you might encounter one-way audio on calls to a Cisco IOS software gateway.\n",
      "Most of these problems can be solved using simple configuration commands.\n",
      "Check if IP routing is enabled on the gateway that you are using—You do not need to be running a routing protocol such as RIP, EIGRP, or OSPF, but IP routing must not be disabled.\n",
      "Make sure that the no ip routing command is not in your configuration.\n",
      "If it is, be sure to eliminate it by configuring the ip routing command.\n",
      "You can also issue the show ip route command to see if IP routing is enabled.\n",
      "If IP routing is disabled, there are no routes listed in the output, and the list of routing protocols is not present.\n",
      "5-13 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations 2.\n",
      "Determine if the VoIP subsystem is enabled—The VoIP subsystem in Cisco IOS software uses the IP routing code to aid in encapsulating and transmitting the VoIP packets, so the subsystem must be enabled to transmit and receive VoIP packets.\n",
      "It does not need the IP routing code to perform signaling such as H.323 or MGCP, so the signaling still works with IP routing disabled.\n",
      "Check IP address configurations on gateway interfaces—Another common occurrence of one-way audio appears on Cisco IOS software H.323 voice gateways that have more than one data interface, such as a gateway that has both an Ethernet connection to the LAN and a serial connection to the WAN.\n",
      "When an H.323 gateway is configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration, you configure a specific IP address.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Communications Manager always uses this IP address for all its signaling to the gateway; however, Cisco IOS software voice gateways by default use the IP address of the interface that is closest to the destination.\n",
      "This could be a problem if Unified Communications Manager is connected via one interface and the device to which the RTP audio stream is destined for is connected to a different interface.\n",
      "To force the voice gateway to always use the same IP address, configure the h323-gateway voip bind srcaddr ip-address command on the interface that you are using for signaling on the Cisco IOS software voice gateway.\n",
      "Make sure this is the same IP address configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration.\n",
      "Failure to do so could result in one-way audio when the gateway tries to use a different source interface than the one configured in Unified Communications Manager.\n",
      "Configure voice rtp send-recv on the gateway—Sometimes you have one-way audio problems only when calling specific numbers, such as 411 or 911 in the North American numbering plan (NANP) or after you transfer a call or put it on hold.\n",
      "If you are having these problems when going through a Cisco IOS software voice gateway, be sure that the voice rtp send-recv command is configured on the gateway.\n",
      "Numbers such as 411 and 911 sometimes do not send back answer supervision (that is, an ISDN connect message) when the remote end answers.\n",
      "As a result, the Cisco IOS software voice gateway does not cut through audio in both directions to prevent toll fraud.\n",
      "Configuring the voice rtp send-recv command forces the voice gateway to cut through audio in both directions immediately.\n",
      "If you are using a Cisco AS5350 or AS5400 as a gateway, configure the no voice-fastpath enable command in global configuration mode—When enabled, this command causes the voice gateway to cache the IP address and UDP port number information for the logical channel opened for a specific call and forwards the packets using the cached information.\n",
      "This helps marginally reduce CPU utilization in high-call-volume scenarios.\n",
      "Because of how Cisco Unified Communications Manager opens and closes logical channels to redirect RTP audio streams, such as in the case of a transfer or music on hold (MOH) server, the Cisco AS5350 and AS5400 cache the IP address information of the old IP address.\n",
      "Therefore, you end up with one-way audio when the call gets redirected to a new IP address because the voice gateway still uses the cached information instead of the newly negotiated information.\n",
      "Check for NAT or Firewall Restrictions One common cause of one-way or no-way audio is when Network Address Translation (NAT), Port Address Translation (PAT), or firewalls exist between two endpoints.\n",
      "The SCCP protocol embeds IP addresses in the IP packet's payload to signal which IP address to send RTP packets to.\n",
      "If the device performing NAT or PAT is unaware of this fact, the embedded IP addresses are not translated.\n",
      "Therefore, one-way or no-way audio results.\n",
      "Firewalls can also be a problem if they are unaware of the voice traffic passing through them.\n",
      "Firewalls often are configured to block all UDP traffic going through them.\n",
      "Because voice traffic is carried over UDP, it might be blocked while the signaling carried over TCP is passed.\n",
      "A sniffer is the best tool for debugging such a scenario.\n",
      "If both devices appear to be transmitting audio but the audio is not reaching 5-14 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations the opposite side, take a sniffer trace at each hop along the way until you find the hop where the audio is not passing through.\n",
      "If the firewall is blocking UDP packets, you might need to open a hole in it to allow the voice traffic to pass through.\n",
      "Problems Occurring After the Call Connects Successfully The scenarios discussed so far are cases in which you have one-way audio or no-way audio from the beginning of the call or after a hold/transfer.\n",
      "Occasionally, however, you might encounter scenarios in which a call is up and suddenly becomes one-way or audio disappears entirely.\n",
      "Network problems are largely to blame for failures of this sort.\n",
      "Ensure that network connectivity between the two endpoints still exists and that nothing on the network might be causing intermittent network connectivity.\n",
      "An example would be a flapping network connection—a network connection that is transitioning between up and down states over and over again—or a routing protocol that cannot converge correctly.\n",
      "Again, a sniffer is the best tool for diagnosing this kind of problem.\n",
      "The best place to start is on the device that originates the RTP stream to ensure that the stream is still being generated when the loss of audio occurs.\n",
      "If you discover that the originating device stops sending packets for no reason, you might be dealing with a software or hardware problem on the originating device.\n",
      "A common cause of such a failure is a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) crash.\n",
      "If the end device is a Cisco IOS software voice gateway, you see an error displayed on the console that looks similar to the following: %VTSP-3-DSP_TIMEOUT: DSP timeout on event 6: DSP ID=0x2312: DSP error stats This message is also sent to a Syslog server if the Cisco IOS software voice gateway is configured to send Syslog information to a Syslog server.\n",
      "On a Cisco VG200, 2600, or 3600, you can issue the following command to check the status of the DSPs: test dsprm slot # The show voice dsp command displays which port and time slot are allocated to each DSP.\n",
      "If the test dsprm slot # command detects a DSP that has crashed, you can compare this with the information obtained from a show call active voice command (or a show call history voice command if the call has been disconnected) to see if the time slot of the failed call is the same as the slot of the DSP that is no longer available.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the only way to recover from this condition is to reload the gateway.\n",

      "Poor Voice Quality Nearly all voice quality problems can be attributed to some kind of degradation on the IP network that the voice traffic traverses.\n",
      "Network problems that might not be noticeable for normal data traffic are very apparent in a voice conversation because of the need to minimize packet loss and variable delay in an IP telephony network.\n",
      "A variety of issues can result in poor voice quality: Packet Drops Queuing Problems 5-15 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations In addition to the information in this section, refer to the Troubleshooting QOS Choppy Voice Issues document on Cisco.com for additional techniques on resolving voice quality issues.\n",
      "Packet Drops IP telephony demands that voice packets reach their destination within a predicable amount of time and without being dropped somewhere along the path from the source to the destination.\n",
      "In a properly designed network with appropriate QoS provisioning in place, packet loss should be near zero.\n",
      "All voice codecs can tolerate some degree of packet loss without dramatically affecting voice quality.\n",
      "Upon detecting a missing packet, the codec decoder on the receiving device makes a best guess as to what the waveform during the missing period of time should have been.\n",
      "Most codecs can tolerate up to five percent random packet loss without noticeable voice quality degradation.\n",
      "This assumes that the five percent of packets being lost are not being lost at the same time, but rather are randomly dropped in groups of one or two packets.\n",
      "Losing multiple simultaneous packets, even as a low percentage of total packets, can cause noticeable voice quality problems.\n",
      "Note You should design your network for zero packet loss for packets that are tagged as voice packets.\n",
      "A converged voice/data network should be engineered to ensure that only a specific number of calls are allowed over a limited-bandwidth link.\n",
      "You should guarantee the bandwidth for those calls by giving priority treatment to voice traffic over all other traffic.\n",
      "For more information on prioritizing voice over data, refer to the Voice Quality information available on Cisco.com.\n",
      "There are various tools that you can use to determine whether you are experiencing packet loss in your network and where in the network the packets are getting dropped.\n",
      "The starting point to look for lost packets is the call statistics screen on Cisco Unified IP Phones.\n",
      "Do one of the following: If you are troubleshooting at the phone experiencing the problem, access these statistics by pressing the help (i or ?)\n",
      "button on the IP phone twice in quick succession during an active call.\n",
      "If you are working with a remote user, open a web browser on your computer and enter the IP address of the user's phone.\n",
      "During an active call, choose the Streaming Statistics > Stream1 options from the display.\n",
      "Examine the counters RxDisc and RxLost shown on the IP phone (or Rcvr Lost Packets if you are viewing the statistics remotely using a web browser).\n",
      "RxLost measures the number of packets that were never received because they were dropped in the network somewhere.\n",
      "By detecting a missing RTP sequence number, the IP phone can determine that a packet has been lost.\n",
      "RxDisc corresponds to packets that were received but were discarded because they could not be used at the time they arrived.\n",
      "RxDisc can come from an out-of-order packet or a packet that arrived too late.\n",
      "If either of these two counters increments, you should investigate to learn why packets are being lost or discarded.\n",
      "Regardless of how low your packet loss is, if it is not zero, you should investigate the root cause because it might be a sign of a bigger problem that will get worse with higher call volume.\n",
      "Also, although small packet loss might not be perceptible in a conversation between two people, it can be detrimental to fax and modem transmissions.\n",
      "The packet loss can be occurring at any layer of the OSI model, so be sure to check for all possibilities for each hop.\n",
      "For example, if there is a Frame Relay connection over a T1 between two sites, you should: Make certain that there are no errors at the physical layer on the T1.\n",
      "5-16 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations Determine if you are exceeding your committed information rate (CIR) on the Frame Relay connection.\n",
      "Verify that you are not dropping the packets at the IP layer because you are exceeding your buffer sizes.\n",
      "Check that you have your QoS improperly configured.\n",
      "Ensure that your service provider not only guarantees packet delivery but also guarantees a low-jitter link.\n",
      "Some service providers may tell you that they do not provide a CIR but guarantee that they will not drop any packets.\n",
      "In a voice environment, delay is as important as packet loss.\n",
      "Many service providers' switches can buffer a large amount of data, thereby causing a large amount of jitter.\n",
      "One common cause of drops in an Ethernet environment is a duplex mismatch, when one side of a connection is set to full duplex and the other side is set to t half duplex.\n",
      "To determine if this is the case, perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Check all the switch ports through which a given call must travel and ensure that there are no alignment or frame check sequence (FCS) errors.\n",
      "Poor cabling or connectors can also contribute to such errors; however, duplex mismatches are a far more common cause of this kind of problem.\n",
      "Examine each link between the two endpoints that are experiencing packet loss and verify that the speed and duplex settings match on either side.\n",
      "Although duplex mismatches are responsible for a large number of packet loss problems, there are many other opportunities for packet loss in other places in the network as well.\n",
      "When voice traffic must traverse a WAN, there are several places to look.\n",
      "First, check each interface between the two endpoints, and look for packet loss.\n",
      "On all Cisco IOS software platforms, you can find this information using the show interface command.\n",
      "If you are seeing dropped packets on any interface, there is a good chance that you are oversubscribing the link.\n",
      "This could also be indicative of some other traffic that you are not expecting on your network.\n",
      "The best solution in this case is to take a sniffer trace to examine which traffic is congesting the link.\n",
      "Sniffers are invaluable in troubleshooting voice quality problems.\n",
      "With a sniffer, you can examine each packet in an RTP stream to see if packets are really being lost and where in the network they are being lost.\n",
      "To troubleshoot using a sniffer, perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Start at the endpoint that is experiencing the poor-quality audio where you suspect packet loss.\n",
      "Take a sniffer trace of a poor-quality call and filter it so that it shows you only packets from the far end to the endpoint that is hearing the problem.\n",
      "The packets should be equally spaced, and the sequence numbers should be consecutive with no gaps.\n",
      "If you are seeing all the packets in the sniffer trace, continue taking traces after each hop until you get a trace where packets are missing.\n",
      "When you have isolated the point in the network where the packet loss is occurring, look for any counters on that device that might indicate where the packets are being lost.\n",
      "Queuing Problems Queuing delay can be a significant contributor to variable delay (jitter).\n",
      "When you have too much jitter end-to-end, you encounter voice quality problems.\n",
      "A voice sample that is delayed over the size of the receiving device's jitter buffer is no better than a packet that is dropped in the network because the delay still causes a noticeable break in the audio stream.\n",
      "In fact, high jitter is actually worse than a small amount of packet loss because most codecs can compensate for small amounts of packet loss.\n",
      "The only way to compensate for high jitter is to make the jitter buffer larger, but as the jitter buffer gets larger, 5-17 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations the voice stream is delayed longer in the jitter buffer.\n",
      "If the jitter buffer gets large enough such that the end-to-end delay is more than 200 ms, the two parties on the conference feel like the conversation is not interactive and start talking over each other.\n",
      "Remember that every network device between the two endpoints involved in a call (switches, routers, firewalls, and so on) is a potential source of queuing or buffering delays.\n",
      "The ideal way to troubleshoot a problem in which the symptoms point to delayed or jittered packets is to use a sniffer trace at each network hop to see where the delay or jitter is being introduced.\n",
      "For more information on jitter, refer to the Understanding Jitter in Packet Voice Networks document on Cisco.com.\n",

      "Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Design for High Availability Design for High Availability Download PDF Design PDF Download Site_Content_PDF Site_Content PDF Cisco IP telephony systems are designed for high availability.\n",
      "In order to achieve this, the design must include redundancy for failover and rapid recovery.\n",
      "For recommendations and design assistance from Cisco Advanced Services, see Navigating the Road to Five Nines .\n",
      "The Unified Communications Manager plays the key role in maintaining call processing following a failure in an IP telephony environment.\n",
      "This topic describes the following high-availability features that are built into Unified Communications Manager: • Unified Communications Manager Clusters • Unified Communications Manager Redundancy Groups • Keepalive Mechanism Note The information in this topic applies to multiple Unified Communications Manager server clusters in a large enterprise environment and does not apply to Cisco Unified Communications Manager Business Edition.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Communications Manager Business Edition is a single-server solution designed for medium businesses up to a maximum of 500 employees and does not offer redundancy.\n",
      "Unified Communications Manager Clusters A cluster comprises a set of Unified Communications Manager servers (or nodes ) that share the same database and resources.\n",
      "Unified Communications Manager servers can be configured to perform the following functions: database server, TFTP server, or application software server.\n",
      "You can dedicate a particular server to one function or combine several functions on one server, depending on the size of your network and the level of redundancy desired.\n",
      "Each cluster can have only one database server (also called the first node ) and usually one TFTP server (either separate or combined with another function).\n",
      "Cisco Systems recommends that large enterprise networks contain a dedicated Unified Communications Manager database server with other servers (called subsequent nodes ) running the Unified Communications Manager application software.\n",
      "The Unified Communications Manager application software performs all call control, including signaling of endpoints, feature invocation, and calling restrictions.\n",
      "Large-scale networks typically use paired redundant application software servers, running in an active-active configuration, with endpoints evenly distributed across the two servers.\n",
      "The TFTP server provides configuration files for the endpoint devices and the associated firmware loads.\n",
      "Large enterprise networks typically use redundant TFTP servers.\n",
      "Unified Communications Manager Redundancy Groups A redundancy group comprises a prioritized list of up to three Unified Communications Manager servers.\n",
      "You can associate each group with one or more device pools to provide call processing redundancy.\n",
      "Each group must contain a primary Unified Communications Manager, and it may contain one or two backup Unified Communications Manager servers.\n",
      "If the primary Unified Communications Manager fails for any reason, the first backup Unified Communications Manager in the group takes control of the devices that were registered with the primary Unified Communications Manager.\n",
      "If you specify a second backup Unified Communications Manager for the group, it takes control of the devices if both the primary and the first backup Unified Communications Manager servers fail.\n",
      "When a failed primary Unified Communications Manager comes back into service, it takes control of the group again, and the devices in that group automatically reregister with the primary Unified Communications Manager.\n",
      "Keepalive Mechanism A keepalive mechanism is an essential part of an IP telephony solution.\n",
      "Keepalives ensure that endpoints (typically phones and gateways) retain their communications path to a Unified Communications Manager server.\n",
      "Keepalives not only determine when the primary Unified Communications Manager server is no longer available, they also determine when the site has become completely isolated from a centralized call control system and must revert to some form of remote survivability capability such as Cisco Unified SRST.\n",
      "Keepalives avoid delays in establishing a call caused by searching for an available Unified Communications Manager server.\n",

      "Unified Communications Manager servers can be configured to perform the following functions: database server, TFTP server, or application software server.\n",
      "You can dedicate a particular server to one function or combine several functions on one server, depending on the size of your network and the level of redundancy desired.\n",
      "Each cluster can have only one database server (also called the first node) and usually one TFTP server (either separate or combined with another function).\n",
      "Cisco Systems recommends that large enterprise networks contain a dedicated Unified Communications Manager database server with other servers (called subsequent nodes) running the Unified Communications Manager application software.\n",
      "The Unified Communications Manager application software performs all call control, including signaling of endpoints, feature invocation, and calling restrictions.\n",
      "Large-scale networks typically use paired redundant application software servers, running in an active-active configuration, with endpoints evenly distributed across the two servers.\n",
      "The TFTP server provides configuration files for the endpoint devices and the associated firmware loads.\n",
      "Large enterprise networks typically use redundant TFTP servers.\n",
      "Unified Communications Manager Redundancy Groups A redundancy group comprises a prioritized list of up to three Unified Communications Manager servers.\n",
      "You can associate each group with one or more device pools to provide call processing redundancy.\n",
      "Each group must contain a primary Unified Communications Manager, and it may contain one or two backup Unified Communications Manager servers.\n",
      "If the primary Unified Communications Manager fails for any reason, the first backup Unified Communications Manager in the group takes control of the devices that were registered with the primary Unified Communications Manager.\n",
      "If you specify a second backup Unified Communications Manager for the group, it takes control of the devices if both the primary and the first backup Unified Communications Manager servers fail.\n",
      "When a failed primary Unified Communications Manager comes back into service, it takes control of the group again, and the devices in that group automatically reregister with the primary Unified Communications Manager.\n",
      "Keepalive Mechanism A keepalive mechanism is an essential part of an IP telephony solution.\n",
      "Keepalives ensure that endpoints (typically phones and gateways) retain their communications path to a Unified Communications Manager server.\n",
      "Keepalives not only determine when the primary Unified Communications Manager server is no longer available, they also determine when the site has become completely isolated from a centralized call control system and must revert to some form of remote survivability capability such as Cisco Unified SRST.\n",

      "Its built-in rules, which provide contextual diagnostics, enable rapid troubleshooting of key service-impacting outages.\n",
      "Note Cisco Unified Operations Manager is designed for large enterprise networks and each Cisco Unified Operations Manager server can monitor up to 30,000 phones.\n",
      "For small or medium-sized businesses up to 1000 phones or users, Cisco also offers Cisco netManager - Unified Communications that provides similar capabilities.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Operations Manager provides a real-time, service-level view of the entire Cisco Unified Communications system and presents contextual tools to look at the current alert status, historical information, and service impact of any outages.\n",
      "It continuously monitors the different elements such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, Cisco Unity, Cisco Unity Express, Cisco Unity Connection, Cisco Unified Contact Center Express, Cisco Emergency Responder, Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Express, and Cisco Unified Presence, as well as Cisco gateways, routers, switches, and IP phones.\n",
      "For a complete list of devices that can be monitored, see the appropriate Device Support Table for Cisco Unified Operations Manager .\n",
      "Other Cisco Unified Operations Manager capabilities include: •Synthetic tests that replicate end-user activity and verify gateway availability as well as other configuration aspects of the Cisco Unified Communications infrastructure.\n",
      "Tests may be run on synthetic phones or real IP phones (both SIP- and SCCP-based phones) deployed in the network.\n",
      "•Cisco IOS IP Service Level Agreement (SLA)-based diagnostic tests that can be used to troubleshoot network-related issues, determine paths, and proactively monitor voice quality across WAN links.\n",
      "•Tools to discover and report on the status of different video-enabled IP endpoints (for both SIP- and SCCP-based phones) in the Cisco Unified Communications system, as well as additional contextual information to locate and identify the IP phones.\n",
      "It can also track the status of these endpoints, such as when IP phones in your network that have become disconnected from the switch, are no longer registered to a Unified Communications Manager server, or have gone into SRST mode.\n",
      "•Test probes to run dial-plan tests, acceptance tests, and phone-feature tests.\n",
      "Such phone-testing capabilities may be used to rapidly troubleshoot issues related to connectivity (signaling/media stream) and voice quality as well as call processing/dial-plan management issues.\n",
      "•Visibility into key performance metrics of different Cisco Unified Communications elements, such as resource usage (CPU, memory, MTP resources, transcoder resources), call statistics (active calls), and trunk statistics (trunk usage, port usage, and gateway statistics) that aid in troubleshooting and capacity planning.\n",
      "•Correlation and presentation of voice-quality alerts using the information available through Cisco Unified Service Monitor (when the latter is also deployed).\n",
      "Cisco Unified Operations Manager displays mean opinion scores associated with voice quality between pairs of endpoints (IP phones, Cisco Unity messaging systems, or voice gateways) at specified times involved in the monitored call segment and other associated details about the voice-quality problem.\n",
      "It can also trace a probable path between the two endpoints and report on any outages or problems on intermediate nodes in the path.\n",
      "•Tracking of Cisco Unified Communications devices and IP phone inventory, including IP phone status changes, and creation of reports that document move, add, and change operations on IP phones in the network.\n",

      "Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Common Problems Reported by Users Common Problems Reported by Users Download PDF Operate PDF Download Site_Content_PDF Site_Content PDF This section describes basic approaches to diagnose and resolve common problems reported by end users.\n",
      "Note that this section demonstrates various tools and diagnostic approaches available in the context of specific problems, but does not provide a comprehensive list of all possible problems that may occur.\n",
      "Problems described in this section include: •One-Way Audio •Poor Voice Quality One-Way Audio One-way audio and no audio at all (no-way audio) are problems that are fairly common during a new network installation.\n",
      "The majority of these problems are caused by misconfigurations.\n",
      "For one-way audio problems, always pay attention the direction in which the one-way audio is occurring.\n",
      "For no audio in either direction, the troubleshooting methodology is the same.\n",
      "You might need to repeat the procedure for each direction of audio, but more likely you will find the source of the problem when trying to troubleshoot one direction.\n",
      "There are several steps you can take to troubleshoot a one-way/no-way audio problem: 1.\n",
      "Verify Bidirectional IP Connectivity.\n",
      "Check Cisco IOS Software Gateway Configurations.\n",
      "Check for NAT or Firewall Restrictions.\n",
      "For additional directions on troubleshooting one-way audio problems, refer to the Troubleshooting One-Way Voice Issues Tech Note .\n",
      "Verify Bidirectional IP Connectivity You should verify IP connectivity as the first step in troubleshooting a one-way or no-way audio problem because IP connectivity must be present for voice packets to be exchanged between two devices.\n",
      "A large number of one-way or no-way audio problems are caused by lack of IP connectivity.\n",
      "Check that: •If the two endpoints involved in the call are on different IP subnets, each endpoint has the correct default gateway and subnet mask settings •If one of the endpoints is a Unified IP phone, the DHCP scope has an incorrectly configured default gateway parameter.\n",
      "•If one of the endpoints is a Cisco IOS software gateway, the default route is correct.\n",
      "Also, ping the other endpoint from the gateway.\n",
      "If the ping is successful, you know that you have IP connectivity.\n",
      "If the ping is unsuccessful, perform a traceroute to determine where the problem lies.\n",
      "Note Remember that signaling packet traffic is always between Unified Communications Manager and the endpoint, whereas the RTP voice packet traffic is directly between the endpoints.\n",
      "So just because the endpoints are registered to Unified Communications Manager and can set up a call through Unified Communications Manager does not mean that the endpoints have proper IP connectivity between them.\n",
      "Another useful tool for troubleshooting such a problem is the help ( i or ? )\n",
      "button on Cisco Unified IP phones.\n",
      "Press the help ( i or ? )\n",
      "button twice in quick succession during an active call.\n",
      "The display shows you receive and transmit statistics for the call.\n",
      "If you do not see the receive counter (RxCnt) incrementing, the packets are probably not arriving on that IP phone.\n",
      "If you go to the originating IP phone and the transmit count (TxCnt) is incrementing, the packets are probably being lost somewhere in the network.\n",
      "If a ping or traceroute does not provide enough information about where the packets are being lost, you may need to connect a sniffer to the network and perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Connect the sniffer to the back of the originating IP phone and make verify that the phone is actually transmitting packets.\n",
      "On the originating phone, verify that the IP address and MAC address information is correct.\n",
      "If the network settings on the originating phone are correct, go to the terminating IP phone to verify that the packets are not arriving.\n",
      "If the voice packets are not arriving at the terminating phone, move the sniffer from network hop to network hop to isolate where the packets are being dropped.\n",
      "A common reason for a problem such as this is a missing or improperly configured IP route.\n",
      "Check Cisco IOS Software Gateway Configurations There are various reasons why you might encounter one-way audio on calls to a Cisco IOS software gateway.\n",
      "Most of these problems can be solved using simple configuration commands.\n",
      "Check if IP routing is enabled on the gateway that you are using—You do not need to be running a routing protocol such as RIP, EIGRP, or OSPF, but IP routing must not be disabled.\n",
      "Make sure that the no ip routing command is not in your configuration.\n",
      "If it is, be sure to eliminate it by configuring the ip routing command.\n",
      "You can also issue the show ip route command to see if IP routing is enabled.\n",
      "If IP routing is disabled, there are no routes listed in the output, and the list of routing protocols is not present.\n",
      "Determine if the VoIP subsystem is enabled—The VoIP subsystem in Cisco IOS software uses the IP routing code to aid in encapsulating and transmitting the VoIP packets, so the subsystem must be enabled to transmit and receive VoIP packets.\n",
      "It does not need the IP routing code to perform signaling such as H.323 or MGCP, so the signaling still works with IP routing disabled.\n",
      "Check IP address configurations on gateway interfaces—Another common occurrence of one-way audio appears on Cisco IOS software H.323 voice gateways that have more than one data interface, such as a gateway that has both an Ethernet connection to the LAN and a serial connection to the WAN.\n",
      "When an H.323 gateway is configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration, you configure a specific IP address.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Communications Manager always uses this IP address for all its signaling to the gateway; however, Cisco IOS software voice gateways by default use the IP address of the interface that is closest to the destination.\n",
      "This could be a problem if Unified Communications Manager is connected via one interface and the device to which the RTP audio stream is destined for is connected to a different interface.\n",
      "To force the voice gateway to always use the same IP address, configure the h323-gateway voip bind srcaddr ip-address command on the interface that you are using for signaling on the Cisco IOS software voice gateway.\n",
      "Make sure this is the same IP address configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration.\n",
      "Failure to do so could result in one-way audio when the gateway tries to use a different source interface than the one configured in Unified Communications Manager.\n",
      "Configure voice rtp send-recv on the gateway—Sometimes you have one-way audio problems only when calling specific numbers, such as 411 or 911 in the North American numbering plan (NANP) or after you transfer a call or put it on hold.\n",
      "If you are having these problems when going through a Cisco IOS software voice gateway, be sure that the voice rtp send-recv command is configured on the gateway.\n",
      "Numbers such as 411 and 911 sometimes do not send back answer supervision (that is, an ISDN connect message) when the remote end answers.\n",
      "As a result, the Cisco IOS software voice gateway does not cut through audio in both directions to prevent toll fraud.\n",
      "Configuring the voice rtp send-recv command forces the voice gateway to cut through audio in both directions immediately.\n",
      "If you are using a Cisco AS5350 or AS5400 as a gateway, configure the no voice-fastpath enable command in global configuration mode—When enabled, this command causes the voice gateway to cache the IP address and UDP port number information for the logical channel opened for a specific call and forwards the packets using the cached information.\n",
      "This helps marginally reduce CPU utilization in high-call-volume scenarios.\n",
      "Because of how Cisco Unified Communications Manager opens and closes logical channels to redirect RTP audio streams, such as in the case of a transfer or music on hold (MOH) server, the Cisco AS5350 and AS5400 cache the IP address information of the old IP address.\n",
      "Therefore, you end up with one-way audio when the call gets redirected to a new IP address because the voice gateway still uses the cached information instead of the newly negotiated information.\n",
      "Check for NAT or Firewall Restrictions One common cause of one-way or no-way audio is when Network Address Translation (NAT), Port Address Translation (PAT), or firewalls exist between two endpoints.\n",
      "The SCCP protocol embeds IP addresses in the IP packet's payload to signal which IP address to send RTP packets to.\n",
      "If the device performing NAT or PAT is unaware of this fact, the embedded IP addresses are not translated.\n",
      "Therefore, one-way or no-way audio results.\n",
      "Firewalls can also be a problem if they are unaware of the voice traffic passing through them.\n",
      "Firewalls often are configured to block all UDP traffic going through them.\n",
      "Because voice traffic is carried over UDP, it might be blocked while the signaling carried over TCP is passed.\n",
      "A sniffer is the best tool for debugging such a scenario.\n",
      "If both devices appear to be transmitting audio but the audio is not reaching the opposite side, take a sniffer trace at each hop along the way until you find the hop where the audio is not passing through.\n",
      "If the firewall is blocking UDP packets, you might need to open a hole in it to allow the voice traffic to pass through.\n",
      "Problems Occurring After the Call Connects Successfully The scenarios discussed so far are cases in which you have one-way audio or no-way audio from the beginning of the call or after a hold/transfer.\n",
      "Occasionally, however, you might encounter scenarios in which a call is up and suddenly becomes one-way or audio disappears entirely.\n",
      "Network problems are largely to blame for failures of this sort.\n",
      "Ensure that network connectivity between the two endpoints still exists and that nothing on the network might be causing intermittent network connectivity.\n",
      "An example would be a flapping network connection—a network connection that is transitioning between up and down states over and over again—or a routing protocol that cannot converge correctly.\n",
      "Again, a sniffer is the best tool for diagnosing this kind of problem.\n",
      "The best place to start is on the device that originates the RTP stream to ensure that the stream is still being generated when the loss of audio occurs.\n",
      "If you discover that the originating device stops sending packets for no reason, you might be dealing with a software or hardware problem on the originating device.\n",
      "A common cause of such a failure is a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) crash.\n",
      "If the end device is a Cisco IOS software voice gateway, you see an error displayed on the console that looks similar to the following: %VTSP-3-DSP_TIMEOUT: DSP timeout on event 6: DSP ID=0x2312: DSP error stats This message is also sent to a Syslog server if the Cisco IOS software voice gateway is configured to send Syslog information to a Syslog server.\n",
      "On a Cisco VG200, 2600, or 3600, you can issue the following command to check the status of the DSPs: test dsprm slot # The show voice dsp command displays which port and time slot are allocated to each DSP.\n",
      "If the test dsprm slot # command detects a DSP that has crashed, you can compare this with the information obtained from a show call active voice command (or a show call history voice command if the call has been disconnected) to see if the time slot of the failed call is the same as the slot of the DSP that is no longer available.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the only way to recover from this condition is to reload the gateway.\n",
      "Poor Voice Quality Nearly all voice quality problems can be attributed to some kind of degradation on the IP network that the voice traffic traverses.\n",
      "Network problems that might not be noticeable for normal data traffic are very apparent in a voice conversation because of the need to minimize packet loss and variable delay in an IP telephony network.\n",
      "A variety of issues can result in poor voice quality: •Packet Drops •Queuing Problems In addition to the information in this section, refer to the Troubleshooting QOS Choppy Voice Issues document on Cisco.com for additional techniques on resolving voice quality issues.\n",
      "Packet Drops IP telephony demands that voice packets reach their destination within a predicable amount of time and without being dropped somewhere along the path from the source to the destination.\n",
      "In a properly designed network with appropriate QoS provisioning in place, packet loss should be near zero.\n",
      "All voice codecs can tolerate some degree of packet loss without dramatically affecting voice quality.\n",
      "Upon detecting a missing packet, the codec decoder on the receiving device makes a best guess as to what the waveform during the missing period of time should have been.\n",
      "Most codecs can tolerate up to five percent random packet loss without noticeable voice quality degradation.\n",
      "This assumes that the five percent of packets being lost are not being lost at the same time, but rather are randomly dropped in groups of one or two packets.\n",
      "Losing multiple simultaneous packets, even as a low percentage of total packets, can cause noticeable voice quality problems.\n",
      "Note You should design your network for zero packet loss for packets that are tagged as voice packets.\n",
      "A converged voice/data network should be engineered to ensure that only a specific number of calls are allowed over a limited-bandwidth link.\n",
      "You should guarantee the bandwidth for those calls by giving priority treatment to voice traffic over all other traffic.\n",
      "For more information on prioritizing voice over data, refer to the Voice Quality information available on Cisco.com.\n",
      "There are various tools that you can use to determine whether you are experiencing packet loss in your network and where in the network the packets are getting dropped.\n",
      "The starting point to look for lost packets is the call statistics screen on Cisco Unified IP Phones.\n",
      "Do one of the following: •If you are troubleshooting at the phone experiencing the problem, access these statistics by pressing the help ( i or ? )\n",
      "button on the IP phone twice in quick succession during an active call.\n",
      "•If you are working with a remote user, open a web browser on your computer and enter the IP address of the user's phone.\n",
      "During an active call, choose the Streaming Statistics > Stream 1 options from the display.\n",
      "Examine the counters RxDisc and RxLost shown on the IP phone (or Rcvr Lost Packets if you are viewing the statistics remotely using a web browser).\n",
      "•RxLost measures the number of packets that were never received because they were dropped in the network somewhere.\n",
      "By detecting a missing RTP sequence number, the IP phone can determine that a packet has been lost.\n",
      "•RxDisc corresponds to packets that were received but were discarded because they could not be used at the time they arrived.\n",
      "RxDisc can come from an out-of-order packet or a packet that arrived too late.\n",
      "If either of these two counters increments, you should investigate to learn why packets are being lost or discarded.\n",
      "Regardless of how low your packet loss is, if it is not zero, you should investigate the root cause because it might be a sign of a bigger problem that will get worse with higher call volume.\n",
      "Also, although small packet loss might not be perceptible in a conversation between two people, it can be detrimental to fax and modem transmissions.\n",
      "The packet loss can be occurring at any layer of the OSI model, so be sure to check for all possibilities for each hop.\n",
      "For example, if there is a Frame Relay connection over a T1 between two sites, you should: •Make certain that there are no errors at the physical layer on the T1.\n",
      "•Determine if you are exceeding your committed information rate (CIR) on the Frame Relay connection.\n",
      "•Verify that you are not dropping the packets at the IP layer because you are exceeding your buffer sizes.\n",
      "•Check that you have your QoS improperly configured.\n",
      "•Ensure that your service provider not only guarantees packet delivery but also guarantees a low-jitter link.\n",
      "Some service providers may tell you that they do not provide a CIR but guarantee that they will not drop any packets.\n",
      "In a voice environment, delay is as important as packet loss.\n",
      "Many service providers' switches can buffer a large amount of data, thereby causing a large amount of jitter.\n",
      "One common cause of drops in an Ethernet environment is a duplex mismatch, when one side of a connection is set to full duplex and the other side is set to t half duplex.\n",
      "To determine if this is the case, perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Check all the switch ports through which a given call must travel and ensure that there are no alignment or frame check sequence (FCS) errors.\n",
      "Poor cabling or connectors can also contribute to such errors; however, duplex mismatches are a far more common cause of this kind of problem.\n",
      "Examine each link between the two endpoints that are experiencing packet loss and verify that the speed and duplex settings match on either side.\n",
      "Although duplex mismatches are responsible for a large number of packet loss problems, there are many other opportunities for packet loss in other places in the network as well.\n",
      "When voice traffic must traverse a WAN, there are several places to look.\n",
      "First, check each interface between the two endpoints, and look for packet loss.\n",
      "On all Cisco IOS software platforms, you can find this information using the show interface command.\n",
      "If you are seeing dropped packets on any interface, there is a good chance that you are oversubscribing the link.\n",
      "This could also be indicative of some other traffic that you are not expecting on your network.\n",
      "The best solution in this case is to take a sniffer trace to examine which traffic is congesting the link.\n",
      "Sniffers are invaluable in troubleshooting voice quality problems.\n",
      "With a sniffer, you can examine each packet in an RTP stream to see if packets are really being lost and where in the network they are being lost.\n",
      "To troubleshoot using a sniffer, perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Start at the endpoint that is experiencing the poor-quality audio where you suspect packet loss.\n",
      "Take a sniffer trace of a poor-quality call and filter it so that it shows you only packets from the far end to the endpoint that is hearing the problem.\n",
      "The packets should be equally spaced, and the sequence numbers should be consecutive with no gaps.\n",
      "If you are seeing all the packets in the sniffer trace, continue taking traces after each hop until you get a trace where packets are missing.\n",
      "When you have isolated the point in the network where the packet loss is occurring, look for any counters on that device that might indicate where the packets are being lost.\n",
      "Queuing Problems Queuing delay can be a significant contributor to variable delay ( jitter ).\n",
      "When you have too much jitter end-to-end, you encounter voice quality problems.\n",
      "A voice sample that is delayed over the size of the receiving device's jitter buffer is no better than a packet that is dropped in the network because the delay still causes a noticeable break in the audio stream.\n",
      "In fact, high jitter is actually worse than a small amount of packet loss because most codecs can compensate for small amounts of packet loss.\n",
      "The only way to compensate for high jitter is to make the jitter buffer larger, but as the jitter buffer gets larger, the voice stream is delayed longer in the jitter buffer.\n",
      "If the jitter buffer gets large enough such that the end-to-end delay is more than 200 ms, the two parties on the conference feel like the conversation is not interactive and start talking over each other.\n",
      "Remember that every network device between the two endpoints involved in a call (switches, routers, firewalls, and so on) is a potential source of queuing or buffering delays.\n",
      "The ideal way to troubleshoot a problem in which the symptoms point to delayed or jittered packets is to use a sniffer trace at each network hop to see where the delay or jitter is being introduced.\n",
      "For more information on jitter, refer to the Understanding Jitter in Packet Voice Networks document on Cisco.com.\n",

      "At a minimum, your network topology diagrams should include the following information: •The name assigned to each major device (typically the DNS name) •IP addresses for all devices in the network –Addresses for each router, core and access switch –Addresses for all telephony and application servers, including the IP address for each server in a Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster –DHCP address range for addresses assigned to endpoints such as IP phones and agent workstations •Phone extension number ranges assigned to sets of agents or users, as well as the main inbound dial-up numbers for each location.\n",
      "This information is useful in resolving dial plan configuration errors.\n",
      "•WAN IP and PSTN links between sites.\n",
      "This information is critical for isolating which components are involved in a particular problem.\n",
      "For medium- to large-sized networks, you may want to take a \"layered\" approach in your diagrams.\n",
      "Create a high-level diagram that illustrates the overall physical layout of your network, including all sites and the links between them.\n",
      "Then for each site create additional diagrams that show detailed addressing information, port numbers and dial plan configurations.\n",
      "Tip Frequent adds, changes and upgrades to your network can quickly make these diagrams out-of-date.\n",
      "Inaccurate diagrams slow down the troubleshooting process and may lead to misdiagnosing the problem.\n",
      "Remember to keep these diagrams as current as possible.\n",
      "Figure 1 shows a typical high-level topology diagram for a medium-sized enterprise IP telephony network.\n",
      "Note that only device names and IP addresses are listed in the diagram.\n",
      "Figure 1 IP Telephony Network Topology Diagram Example Synchronizing Server Date and Time The best resources for diagnosing problems within your network are the debug and trace log files produced by individual Cisco devices.\n",
      "Tracing can be enabled on multiple devices and the log file output compared to isolate problems.\n",
      "In order to correlate messages for the same activity in different log files, you must compare the message timestamps and the source device MAC and IP addresses (there is no universal call ID value shared between Cisco devices).\n",
      "You should synchronize every device to the same date and time source so that the timestamps match.\n",
      "To accomplish this synchronization, set each device to obtain its date and time from the same Network Time Protocol (NTP) source.\n",
      "For Cisco IOS-based devices (switches, routers or voice gateways), you can configure each device to act as a NTP client and periodically poll a master NTP source using the following command: ntp server ip-address [version number ] [key keyid ] [source interface ] [prefer] Additional IOS commands are available to establish a device as a NTP peer (operating as the master source for other devices), as well as setting up NTP broadcasting instead of polling.\n",
      "See the Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals Command Reference for details on these IOS commands.\n",
      "Recommended Trace/Logging Settings In order to have diagnostic information available when you begin to research problems, you must configure devices in your network to capture signaling, processing and other activity in log files.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Communications Manager Trace Settings Trace settings for Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers are maintained using the Cisco Communications Manager Serviceability graphical interface.\n",
      "There are two ways to set trace logging levels for Unified Communications Manager services: • Customize trace levels for individual parameters: This approach offers a high-degree of control and flexibility over the trace output.\n",
      "However, in order to use this approach you should understand not only the significance of each parameter, but also the impact of tracing on Unified Communications Manager server performance.\n",
      "For example, setting trace levels to \"Error\" has a minimal impact to CPU cycles while leaving the \"Detail\" level set for long periods of time may impact call processing.\n",
      "For instructions on setting individual trace levels, see the Cisco Unified Serviceability Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, \"Configuring Trace\" chapter .\n",
      "• Apply predefined trace levels : This approach allows you to quickly enable and disable tracing for each Unified Communications Manager service based on predefined levels.\n",
      "You can also use these default troubleshooting trace settings in combination with customized settings to temporarily override the your custom settings.\n",
      "For instructions on using the Troubleshooting Trace Settings option in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Serviceability interface, see the Cisco Unified Serviceability Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, \"Configuring Troubleshooting Trace Setting Configuration\" chapter .\n",
      "Debug Trace Settings for CRS and IP IVR JTAPI Client If you encounter any problems with CRS, activate the following debug trace settings to generate debug logs: •For CRS issues: SS_TEL, SS_ICM, and LIB_ICM.\n",
      "•For JTAPI Client issues: Enable all Trace Levels and select all debug levels except MISC_DEBUGGING.\n",
      "However, deactivate the above trace settings if you experience any degradation in performance during heavy load situations.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) System Troubleshooting Methodology System Troubleshooting Methodology Download PDF Implement PDF Download Site_Content_PDF Site_Content PDF The Implementation phase of your network deployment is an excellent time to develop a methodology for troubleshooting the network as a whole.\n",
      "Troubleshooting networking equipment at a system level requires solid detective skills.\n",
      "When a problem occurs, the list of potential suspects is long.\n",
      "You must collect detailed information and systematically narrow the list of potential causes to determine the root problem.\n",
      "This topic does not provide step-by-instructions for resolving problems that occur during network installation.\n",
      "Instead, this topic describes sound methods for troubleshooting your network using the following general steps: 1.\n",
      "Gather Information on the Problem.\n",
      "Isolate Point(s) of Failure.\n",
      "Apply Tools to Determine the Problem's Root Cause.\n",
      "Gather Information on the Problem In a IP telephony network, problems are typically discovered and reported by one of the following types of users: •External users trying to reach employees within your company •Internal users using phones to call employees in other company locations or PSTN destinations, and perform basic actions such as call transfers and dialing into conferences.\n",
      "As the network administrator, you must collect sufficient information from these users to allow you to isolate the problem.\n",
      "Detailed, accurate information will make this task easier.\n",
      "Table 3 lists recommended questions to ask users when they report a problem.\n",
      "As you turn up your network, you may consider putting these questions in an on-line form.\n",
      "A form will encourage users to provide more details about the problem and also put them into the habit of looking for particular error messages and indicators.\n",
      "Capturing the information electronically will also permit you to retrieve and re-examine this information in the future, should the problem repeat itself.\n",
      "Table 3 Questions to Ask Users When They Report Problems Ask this Question... To Determine... Did something fail or did it simply perform poorly?\n",
      "Whether the issue relates to system degradation or a connectivity failure.\n",
      "An example of a failure is when a user dials a phone number and hears fast busy tone.\n",
      "An example of a performance problem is when a user dials into a conference call and hears \"choppy\" audio when other parties speak.\n",
      "Quality of service or performance issues require a different approach than connectivity or operational problems.\n",
      "You must still isolate the potential sources of the problem, but you will typically use performance management tools instead of log files.\n",
      "What device were you trying to use?\n",
      "The device type, model and version of software installed.\n",
      "It is also critical to capture the IP address assigned to the device, as well as its MAC address.\n",
      "If the case of IP phones, determining the phone's active Cisco Unified Communications Manager server is also important.\n",
      "On Cisco Unified IP phones, these important network values can be displayed by pressing the Settings button and choosing the Network Configuration option from the menu.\n",
      "Did it ever work?\n",
      "If a device was recently installed and the problem occurred while making it work for the first time, or if the device was operating normally before the problem occurred.\n",
      "If the device was newly installed, the problem is most likely due to improper configuration or wiring of that particular device.\n",
      "Problems with devices that are already up and running can typically be traced back to one of two causes: (a) the user modifying their device, such as changing their configuration or upgrading software, or (b) a change or failure elsewhere in the network.\n",
      "Exactly what action(s) did you perform?\n",
      "The steps that led up to the problem, including which buttons were pressed and in which order.\n",
      "Capturing this information in detail is important so that you can consistently reproduce the problem.\n",
      "What error message(s) appeared or announcements did you hear?\n",
      "The visual and audio indicators of the problem.\n",
      "Ask users to provide the exact text that appears and any error codes in either an E-mail or on-line form.\n",
      "If the error indication was audible, ask the user to write down the announcement they heard, the last menu option they were able to successfully choose or the tone they heard when the call failed.\n",
      "What time did the problem occur?\n",
      "The date and time to compare against entries in log files.\n",
      "If the problem occurred on a Cisco Unified IP phone, make certain the user provides the timestamp that appears on their phone's display.\n",
      "Several Cisco components in a network may capture the same problem event in separate log files, with different ID values.\n",
      "In order to correlate log entries written by different components, you must compare the timestamps to find messages for the same event.\n",
      "Cisco Unified IP phones synchronize their date and time with their active Cisco Unified Communications Manager server.\n",
      "If all Cisco components in the network use Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize with the same source, then the timestamps for the same problem messages will match in every log file.\n",
      "What is the number of the phone you used and what was the phone number you called?\n",
      "If the problem relates to a WAN or PTSN link, or a Cisco Unified Communications Manager dial plan issue.\n",
      "Ask the user the phone number he or she dialed (called number) and determine if the destination was within his or her site, another site within the corporate network, or a PSTN destination.\n",
      "Because the calling number (the number of the phone used) also affects call routing in some cases, capture this number as well.\n",
      "Did you try to perform any special actions, such as a transfer, forward, call park, call pickup, or meet-me conference?\n",
      "Is the phone set up to automatically perform any of these actions?\n",
      "If the problem is not directly related to the calling number or called number but rather to the supplementary service setup on Unified Communications Manager or the problem is at the destination phone the user tried to reach by transferring or forwarding the call.\n",
      "Did you attempt the same action on another device?\n",
      "If the problem is isolated to that user's device or represents a more widespread network problem.\n",
      "If the user cannot make a call from his or her phone, ask the user to place a call to the same destination using a phone in a nearby office.\n",
      "Isolate Point(s) of Failure After collecting information on the symptoms and behavior of the problem, to narrow the focus of your efforts you should: •Identify the specific devices involved in the problem.\n",
      "•Check the version of software running on each device.\n",
      "•Determine if something has changed in the network.\n",
      "•Verify the integrity of the IP network.\n",
      "Identify Devices Involved in the Problem In large- to medium-sized networks, it is crucial to identify the specific phones, routers, switches, servers and other devices that were involved in a reported problem.\n",
      "Isolating these devices allows you to rule out the vast majority of equipment within the network and focus your time and energy on suspect devices.\n",
      "To help you isolate which devices were involved in a problem, two types of information can prove invaluable: • Network topology diagrams : It is strongly recommended that you have one or more diagrams that show the arrangement of all Cisco Unified Communications products in your network.\n",
      "These diagrams illustrate how these devices are connected and also capture each device's IP address and name (you may want to also have a spreadsheet or database of the latter information).\n",
      "This information can help you visualize the situation and focus on the devices that may be contributing to the reported problem.\n",
      "See Network Topology Diagrams for recommendations on how to prepare these diagrams.\n",
      "• Call flow diagrams : Cisco equipment, including Unified Communications Manager servers, typically provide detailed debug and call trace log files.\n",
      "To interpret these log files, however, it is useful to understand the signaling that occurs between devices as calls are set up and disconnected.\n",
      "Using the network topology and call flow diagrams in conjunction with the log files, you can trace how far a call progressed before it failed and identify which device reported the problem.\n",
      "Examples of using call flow diagrams for problem isolation are shown in Troubleshooting Daily Operations .\n",
      "Check Software Release Versions for Compatibility After you have identified which devices may be involved in the problem, verify that the version of software running on each device is compatible with the software running on every other device.\n",
      "As part of Cisco Unified Communications Release 6.0(1) verification, Cisco Systems has performed interoperability and load testing on simulated network environments running specific software versions.\n",
      "The Release Matrix lists the combination of software releases that were tested.\n",
      "However, if the combination of releases installed in your network does not match the values in the Release Matrix, it does not necessarily mean the combination is invalid.\n",
      "To check interoperability for a specific device and software release, locate and review its Release Notes.\n",
      "Release Notes contain up-to-date information on compatibility between the product and various releases of other products.\n",
      "This document also describes open caveats, known issues that may cause unexpected behavior.\n",
      "Before beginning extensive troubleshooting work, examine the Release Notes to determine if you are experiencing a known problem that has an available workaround.\n",
      "Tip The Bug Toolkit requires that you are a Cisco partner or a registered Cisco.com user with a Cisco service contract.\n",
      "Using the Bug Toolkit, you can find caveats for any release.\n",
      "To access the Bug Toolkit, go to http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl .\n",
      "Determine if Network Changes Have Occurred Before focusing on the particular device or site where the problem occurred, it may be useful to determine if a change was made to surrounding devices.\n",
      "If something has been added, reconfigured or removed from elsewhere in the network, that change may be the source of the problem.\n",
      "It is recommended that you track changes to the IP telephony network such as: •New user phones added •Modifications to Cisco Unified Communications Manager call routing settings, such as new directory numbers, route patterns and dial rules to support new sites or devices •Changes to port configurations on switches, routers or gateways (new equipment, wiring changes or new port activation) •Changes to IP addressing schemes (such as adding new subnets) that may have affected route tables Verify the IP Network Integrity Always remember that Cisco Unified Communications equipment relies on a backbone IP network.\n",
      "Many connectivity problems are not caused by configuration errors or operational failures on Cisco devices, but rather by the IP network that interconnects them.\n",
      "Problems such as poor voice quality are typically due to IP network congestion, while call failures between locations may be the result of network outages due to disconnected cables or improperly configured IP route tables.\n",
      "Before assuming that call processing problems result from Cisco Unified Communications devices themselves, check the integrity of the backbone IP network.\n",
      "Keep the OSI model in mind as you perform these checks.\n",
      "Start from the bottom, at the physical layer, by checking that end-to-end cabling.\n",
      "Then verify the status of Layer 2 switches, looking for any port errors.\n",
      "Move from there to confirm that the Layer 3 routers are running and contain correct routing tables.\n",
      "Continue up the OSI stack to Layer 7, the application layer.\n",
      "To resolve problems occurring at the top levels of the stack, a protocol analyzer (or \"sniffer\") may be useful.\n",
      "You can use sniffer to examine the IP traffic passing between devices and also decode the packets.\n",
      "Sniffers are particularly useful for troubleshooting errors between devices that communicate using Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n",
      "Apply Tools to Determine the Problem's Root Cause After you have eliminated the IP network as the source of the problem and you have isolated the specific Cisco Unified Communications components involved, you can start applying the many diagnostic tools provided by Cisco components.\n",
      "Table 4 lists the diagnostic tools and supporting troubleshooting documentation available for most components in an IP telephony network.\n",

      "For no audio in either direction, the troubleshooting methodology is the same.\n",
      "You might need to repeat the procedure for each direction of audio, but more likely you will find the source of the problem when trying to troubleshoot one direction.\n",
      "There are several steps you can take to troubleshoot a one-way/no-way audio problem: 1.\n",
      "Verify Bidirectional IP Connectivity.\n",
      "Check Cisco IOS Software Gateway Configurations.\n",
      "5-12 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations 3.\n",
      "Check for NAT or Firewall Restrictions.\n",
      "For additional directions on troubleshooting one-way audio problems, refer to the Troubleshooting One-Way Voice Issues Tech Note .\n",
      "Verify Bidirectional IP Connectivity You should verify IP connectivity as the first step in troubleshooting a one-way or no-way audio problem because IP connectivity must be present for voice packets to be exchanged between two devices.\n",
      "A large number of one-way or no-way audio problems are caused by lack of IP connectivity.\n",
      "Check that: If the two endpoints involved in the call are on different IP subnets, each endpoint has the correct default gateway and subnet mask settings If one of the endpoints is a Unified IP phone, the DHCP scope has an incorrectly configured default gateway parameter.\n",
      "If one of the endpoints is a Cisco IOS software gateway, the default route is correct.\n",
      "Also, ping the other endpoint from the gateway.\n",
      "If the ping is successful, you know that you have IP connectivity.\n",
      "If the ping is unsuccessful, perform a traceroute to determine where the problem lies.\n",
      "Note Remember that signaling packet traffic is always between Unified Communications Manager and the endpoint, whereas the RTP voice packet traffic is directly between the endpoints.\n",
      "So just because the endpoints are registered to Unified Communications Manager and can set up a call through Unified Communications Manager does not mean that the endpoints have proper IP connectivity between them.\n",
      "Another useful tool for troubleshooting such a problem is the help (i or ?)\n",
      "button on Cisco Unified IP phones.\n",
      "Press the help (i or ?)\n",
      "button twice in quick succession during an active call.\n",
      "The display shows you receive and transmit statistics for the call.\n",
      "If you do not see the receive counter (RxCnt) incrementing, the packets are probably not arriving on that IP phone.\n",
      "If you go to the originating IP phone and the transmit count (TxCnt) is incrementing, the packets are probably being lost somewhere in the network.\n",
      "If a ping or traceroute does not provide enough information about where the packets are being lost, you may need to connect a sniffer to the network and perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Connect the sniffer to the back of the originating IP phone and make verify that the phone is actually transmitting packets.\n",
      "On the originating phone, verify that the IP address and MAC address information is correct.\n",
      "If the network settings on the originating phone are correct, go to the terminating IP phone to verify that the packets are not arriving.\n",
      "If the voice packets are not arriving at the terminating phone, move the sniffer from network hop to network hop to isolate where the packets are being dropped.\n",
      "A common reason for a problem such as this is a missing or improperly configured IP route.\n",
      "Check Cisco IOS Software Gateway Configurations There are various reasons why you might encounter one-way audio on calls to a Cisco IOS software gateway.\n",
      "Most of these problems can be solved using simple configuration commands.\n",
      "Check if IP routing is enabled on the gateway that you are using—You do not need to be running a routing protocol such as RIP, EIGRP, or OSPF, but IP routing must not be disabled.\n",
      "Make sure that the no ip routing command is not in your configuration.\n",
      "If it is, be sure to eliminate it by configuring the ip routing command.\n",
      "You can also issue the show ip route command to see if IP routing is enabled.\n",
      "If IP routing is disabled, there are no routes listed in the output, and the list of routing protocols is not present.\n",
      "5-13 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations 2.\n",
      "Determine if the VoIP subsystem is enabled—The VoIP subsystem in Cisco IOS software uses the IP routing code to aid in encapsulating and transmitting the VoIP packets, so the subsystem must be enabled to transmit and receive VoIP packets.\n",
      "It does not need the IP routing code to perform signaling such as H.323 or MGCP, so the signaling still works with IP routing disabled.\n",
      "Check IP address configurations on gateway interfaces—Another common occurrence of one-way audio appears on Cisco IOS software H.323 voice gateways that have more than one data interface, such as a gateway that has both an Ethernet connection to the LAN and a serial connection to the WAN.\n",
      "When an H.323 gateway is configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration, you configure a specific IP address.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Communications Manager always uses this IP address for all its signaling to the gateway; however, Cisco IOS software voice gateways by default use the IP address of the interface that is closest to the destination.\n",
      "This could be a problem if Unified Communications Manager is connected via one interface and the device to which the RTP audio stream is destined for is connected to a different interface.\n",
      "To force the voice gateway to always use the same IP address, configure the h323-gateway voip bind srcaddr ip-address command on the interface that you are using for signaling on the Cisco IOS software voice gateway.\n",
      "Make sure this is the same IP address configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration.\n",
      "Failure to do so could result in one-way audio when the gateway tries to use a different source interface than the one configured in Unified Communications Manager.\n",
      "Configure voice rtp send-recv on the gateway—Sometimes you have one-way audio problems only when calling specific numbers, such as 411 or 911 in the North American numbering plan (NANP) or after you transfer a call or put it on hold.\n",
      "If you are having these problems when going through a Cisco IOS software voice gateway, be sure that the voice rtp send-recv command is configured on the gateway.\n",
      "Numbers such as 411 and 911 sometimes do not send back answer supervision (that is, an ISDN connect message) when the remote end answers.\n",
      "As a result, the Cisco IOS software voice gateway does not cut through audio in both directions to prevent toll fraud.\n",
      "Configuring the voice rtp send-recv command forces the voice gateway to cut through audio in both directions immediately.\n",
      "If you are using a Cisco AS5350 or AS5400 as a gateway, configure the no voice-fastpath enable command in global configuration mode—When enabled, this command causes the voice gateway to cache the IP address and UDP port number information for the logical channel opened for a specific call and forwards the packets using the cached information.\n",
      "This helps marginally reduce CPU utilization in high-call-volume scenarios.\n",
      "Because of how Cisco Unified Communications Manager opens and closes logical channels to redirect RTP audio streams, such as in the case of a transfer or music on hold (MOH) server, the Cisco AS5350 and AS5400 cache the IP address information of the old IP address.\n",
      "Therefore, you end up with one-way audio when the call gets redirected to a new IP address because the voice gateway still uses the cached information instead of the newly negotiated information.\n",
      "Check for NAT or Firewall Restrictions One common cause of one-way or no-way audio is when Network Address Translation (NAT), Port Address Translation (PAT), or firewalls exist between two endpoints.\n",
      "The SCCP protocol embeds IP addresses in the IP packet's payload to signal which IP address to send RTP packets to.\n",
      "If the device performing NAT or PAT is unaware of this fact, the embedded IP addresses are not translated.\n",
      "Therefore, one-way or no-way audio results.\n",
      "Firewalls can also be a problem if they are unaware of the voice traffic passing through them.\n",
      "Firewalls often are configured to block all UDP traffic going through them.\n",
      "Because voice traffic is carried over UDP, it might be blocked while the signaling carried over TCP is passed.\n",
      "A sniffer is the best tool for debugging such a scenario.\n",
      "If both devices appear to be transmitting audio but the audio is not reaching 5-14 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations the opposite side, take a sniffer trace at each hop along the way until you find the hop where the audio is not passing through.\n",
      "If the firewall is blocking UDP packets, you might need to open a hole in it to allow the voice traffic to pass through.\n",
      "Problems Occurring After the Call Connects Successfully The scenarios discussed so far are cases in which you have one-way audio or no-way audio from the beginning of the call or after a hold/transfer.\n",
      "Occasionally, however, you might encounter scenarios in which a call is up and suddenly becomes one-way or audio disappears entirely.\n",
      "Network problems are largely to blame for failures of this sort.\n",
      "Ensure that network connectivity between the two endpoints still exists and that nothing on the network might be causing intermittent network connectivity.\n",
      "An example would be a flapping network connection—a network connection that is transitioning between up and down states over and over again—or a routing protocol that cannot converge correctly.\n",
      "Again, a sniffer is the best tool for diagnosing this kind of problem.\n",
      "The best place to start is on the device that originates the RTP stream to ensure that the stream is still being generated when the loss of audio occurs.\n",
      "If you discover that the originating device stops sending packets for no reason, you might be dealing with a software or hardware problem on the originating device.\n",
      "A common cause of such a failure is a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) crash.\n",
      "If the end device is a Cisco IOS software voice gateway, you see an error displayed on the console that looks similar to the following: %VTSP-3-DSP_TIMEOUT: DSP timeout on event 6: DSP ID=0x2312: DSP error stats This message is also sent to a Syslog server if the Cisco IOS software voice gateway is configured to send Syslog information to a Syslog server.\n",
      "On a Cisco VG200, 2600, or 3600, you can issue the following command to check the status of the DSPs: test dsprm slot # The show voice dsp command displays which port and time slot are allocated to each DSP.\n",
      "If the test dsprm slot # command detects a DSP that has crashed, you can compare this with the information obtained from a show call active voice command (or a show call history voice command if the call has been disconnected) to see if the time slot of the failed call is the same as the slot of the DSP that is no longer available.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the only way to recover from this condition is to reload the gateway.\n",

      "Poor Voice Quality Nearly all voice quality problems can be attributed to some kind of degradation on the IP network that the voice traffic traverses.\n",
      "Network problems that might not be noticeable for normal data traffic are very apparent in a voice conversation because of the need to minimize packet loss and variable delay in an IP telephony network.\n",
      "A variety of issues can result in poor voice quality: Packet Drops Queuing Problems 5-15 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations In addition to the information in this section, refer to the Troubleshooting QOS Choppy Voice Issues document on Cisco.com for additional techniques on resolving voice quality issues.\n",
      "Packet Drops IP telephony demands that voice packets reach their destination within a predicable amount of time and without being dropped somewhere along the path from the source to the destination.\n",
      "In a properly designed network with appropriate QoS provisioning in place, packet loss should be near zero.\n",
      "All voice codecs can tolerate some degree of packet loss without dramatically affecting voice quality.\n",
      "Upon detecting a missing packet, the codec decoder on the receiving device makes a best guess as to what the waveform during the missing period of time should have been.\n",
      "Most codecs can tolerate up to five percent random packet loss without noticeable voice quality degradation.\n",
      "This assumes that the five percent of packets being lost are not being lost at the same time, but rather are randomly dropped in groups of one or two packets.\n",
      "Losing multiple simultaneous packets, even as a low percentage of total packets, can cause noticeable voice quality problems.\n",
      "Note You should design your network for zero packet loss for packets that are tagged as voice packets.\n",
      "A converged voice/data network should be engineered to ensure that only a specific number of calls are allowed over a limited-bandwidth link.\n",
      "You should guarantee the bandwidth for those calls by giving priority treatment to voice traffic over all other traffic.\n",
      "For more information on prioritizing voice over data, refer to the Voice Quality information available on Cisco.com.\n",
      "There are various tools that you can use to determine whether you are experiencing packet loss in your network and where in the network the packets are getting dropped.\n",
      "The starting point to look for lost packets is the call statistics screen on Cisco Unified IP Phones.\n",
      "Do one of the following: If you are troubleshooting at the phone experiencing the problem, access these statistics by pressing the help (i or ?)\n",
      "button on the IP phone twice in quick succession during an active call.\n",
      "If you are working with a remote user, open a web browser on your computer and enter the IP address of the user's phone.\n",
      "During an active call, choose the Streaming Statistics > Stream1 options from the display.\n",
      "Examine the counters RxDisc and RxLost shown on the IP phone (or Rcvr Lost Packets if you are viewing the statistics remotely using a web browser).\n",
      "RxLost measures the number of packets that were never received because they were dropped in the network somewhere.\n",
      "By detecting a missing RTP sequence number, the IP phone can determine that a packet has been lost.\n",
      "RxDisc corresponds to packets that were received but were discarded because they could not be used at the time they arrived.\n",
      "RxDisc can come from an out-of-order packet or a packet that arrived too late.\n",
      "If either of these two counters increments, you should investigate to learn why packets are being lost or discarded.\n",
      "Regardless of how low your packet loss is, if it is not zero, you should investigate the root cause because it might be a sign of a bigger problem that will get worse with higher call volume.\n",
      "Also, although small packet loss might not be perceptible in a conversation between two people, it can be detrimental to fax and modem transmissions.\n",
      "The packet loss can be occurring at any layer of the OSI model, so be sure to check for all possibilities for each hop.\n",
      "For example, if there is a Frame Relay connection over a T1 between two sites, you should: Make certain that there are no errors at the physical layer on the T1.\n",
      "5-16 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations Determine if you are exceeding your committed information rate (CIR) on the Frame Relay connection.\n",
      "Verify that you are not dropping the packets at the IP layer because you are exceeding your buffer sizes.\n",
      "Check that you have your QoS improperly configured.\n",
      "Ensure that your service provider not only guarantees packet delivery but also guarantees a low-jitter link.\n",
      "Some service providers may tell you that they do not provide a CIR but guarantee that they will not drop any packets.\n",
      "In a voice environment, delay is as important as packet loss.\n",
      "Many service providers' switches can buffer a large amount of data, thereby causing a large amount of jitter.\n",
      "One common cause of drops in an Ethernet environment is a duplex mismatch, when one side of a connection is set to full duplex and the other side is set to t half duplex.\n",
      "To determine if this is the case, perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Check all the switch ports through which a given call must travel and ensure that there are no alignment or frame check sequence (FCS) errors.\n",
      "Poor cabling or connectors can also contribute to such errors; however, duplex mismatches are a far more common cause of this kind of problem.\n",
      "Examine each link between the two endpoints that are experiencing packet loss and verify that the speed and duplex settings match on either side.\n",
      "Although duplex mismatches are responsible for a large number of packet loss problems, there are many other opportunities for packet loss in other places in the network as well.\n",
      "When voice traffic must traverse a WAN, there are several places to look.\n",
      "First, check each interface between the two endpoints, and look for packet loss.\n",
      "On all Cisco IOS software platforms, you can find this information using the show interface command.\n",
      "If you are seeing dropped packets on any interface, there is a good chance that you are oversubscribing the link.\n",
      "This could also be indicative of some other traffic that you are not expecting on your network.\n",
      "The best solution in this case is to take a sniffer trace to examine which traffic is congesting the link.\n",
      "Sniffers are invaluable in troubleshooting voice quality problems.\n",
      "With a sniffer, you can examine each packet in an RTP stream to see if packets are really being lost and where in the network they are being lost.\n",
      "To troubleshoot using a sniffer, perform the following steps: 1.\n",
      "Start at the endpoint that is experiencing the poor-quality audio where you suspect packet loss.\n",
      "Take a sniffer trace of a poor-quality call and filter it so that it shows you only packets from the far end to the endpoint that is hearing the problem.\n",
      "The packets should be equally spaced, and the sequence numbers should be consecutive with no gaps.\n",
      "If you are seeing all the packets in the sniffer trace, continue taking traces after each hop until you get a trace where packets are missing.\n",
      "When you have isolated the point in the network where the packet loss is occurring, look for any counters on that device that might indicate where the packets are being lost.\n",
      "Queuing Problems Queuing delay can be a significant contributor to variable delay (jitter).\n",
      "When you have too much jitter end-to-end, you encounter voice quality problems.\n",
      "A voice sample that is delayed over the size of the receiving device's jitter buffer is no better than a packet that is dropped in the network because the delay still causes a noticeable break in the audio stream.\n",
      "In fact, high jitter is actually worse than a small amount of packet loss because most codecs can compensate for small amounts of packet loss.\n",
      "The only way to compensate for high jitter is to make the jitter buffer larger, but as the jitter buffer gets larger, 5-17 Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Chapter5 Operate Troubleshooting Daily Operations the voice stream is delayed longer in the jitter buffer.\n",
      "If the jitter buffer gets large enough such that the end-to-end delay is more than 200 ms, the two parties on the conference feel like the conversation is not interactive and start talking over each other.\n",
      "Remember that every network device between the two endpoints involved in a call (switches, routers, firewalls, and so on) is a potential source of queuing or buffering delays.\n",
      "The ideal way to troubleshoot a problem in which the symptoms point to delayed or jittered packets is to use a sniffer trace at each network hop to see where the delay or jitter is being introduced.\n",
      "For more information on jitter, refer to the Understanding Jitter in Packet Voice Networks document on Cisco.com.\n",

      "Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Capacity and QoS Capacity and QoS Download PDF Prepare and Plan PDF Download Site_Content_PDF Site_Content PDF Capacity and QoS are major considerations in a converged network and effect one another.\n",
      "QoS is needed to prevent applications from using more than a fair share of bandwidth and degrading the performance of other applications.\n",
      "At the WAN interface, QoS is needed to allocate expensive wide area capacity among applications.\n",
      "Bandwidth and QoS requirements are easy to figure in a multilayered design because the traffic flow is fairly predictable.\n",
      "You can also have end-to-end QoS in a multilayered design.\n",
      "End-to-end QoS is critical when you have real-time applications, such as a voice conversation or video presentation, and you have non-real time applications that can interfere with the real-time applications.\n",
      "For example, if the real-time and non-real time applications arrive at the same layer at the same time, the network must pass the real-time packets first, as well as keep latency and jitter low.\n",
      "QoS end-to-end is the answer.\n",
      "Consider Call Admission Control (CAC) as an alternative to QoS.\n",
      "CAC limits the amount of traffic allowed onto the network at the ingress point.\n",
      "Because you know that the network will be congested at various times during the day, you can disallow additional traffic by using CAC.\n",
      "Also consider using traffic-shaping techniques using a traffic-shaping device.\n",
      "A combination of QoS, CAC and traffic shaping will provide optimal performance for applications on a converged network.\n",
      "Managing link speed mismatches is the last element of traffic management.\n",
      "The mismatches, called chokepoints or bottlenecks, are a basic design issue whenever a large capacity link generates traffic destined for a low capacity link.To avoid the mismatches, carefully analyze the traffic and the device capabilities, then upgrade the interface (if needed) and apply a combination of CAC and QoS.\n",

      "Some groups might require access to common servers, while others might want to allow external access to specific internal computing resources.\n",
      "Formal surveys can be used to get a statistically valid reading of user sentiment regarding a particular service level or proposed internetworking architecture.\n",
      "–Conduct a test involving representative users in a lab environment.\n",
      "This is most applicable when evaluating response time requirements.\n",
      "As an example, you might set up working systems and have users perform normal remote host activities from the lab network.\n",
      "By evaluating user reactions to variations in host responsiveness, you can create benchmark thresholds for acceptable performance.\n",
      "•Identify Functionality Requirements—After you understand your internetworking requirements, you can select the specific functionality that fits your environment, such as the level of application availability and the implementation costs for that availability.\n",

      "For example, in Cisco Unified Communications release 5.1(1), \"5\" indicates the major release, the first \"1\" indicates the minor release, and the second \"1\" indicates the maintenance release.\n",
      "Cisco Unified Communications System for IP Telephony Release 6.0(1) Intelligent Information Network Intelligent Information Network Download PDF Prepare and Plan PDF Download Site_Content_PDF Site_Content PDF The Cisco Intelligent Information Network facilitates the evolution of networking to systems.\n",
      "It allows the network to be used as a strategic asset and provides capabilities that include: •Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)—A simple broadcast protocol that devices use to advertise their presence, it operates in the background and facilitates communication between a Cisco Unified IP Phone plugged into a network and the network switch.\n",
      "•QoS—Cisco provides an end-to-end solution to ensure quality of service.\n",
      "QoS starts at the phone and LAN distribution layer, where packets are classified and marked as high priority traffic.\n",
      "Traffic markings originating from Cisco Unified IP Phones are automatically trusted by the Cisco switch infrastructure, which typically remarks traffic from nontrusted end user workstations.\n",
      "Configuration is made easier through Cisco AutoQoS, which automatically handles a range of tasks traditionally done manually, including classifying applications, generating policies, configuring the proper QoS configurations, monitoring and reporting to test QoS effectiveness, and enforcing service-level consistency.\n",
      "As traffic flows through the access layer, priority queuing and buffer management ensure that real-time traffic is prioritized over less time-critical data.\n",
      "Where bandwidth is most restricted, across the WAN, the Cisco solution provides RSVP for reserving the bandwidth needed for voice.\n",
      "Fragmentation and interleaving of large blocks of data ensure a steady stream of voice traffic, and voice packet header compression minimizes bandwidth consumed.\n",
      "•VLAN—When a Cisco Unified IP Phone boots up on the IP network, it advertises its presence using CDP, and it requests an IP address lease from a DHCP server.\n",
      "The Cisco LAN switch learns of the new phones via CDP and automatically reconfigures to add that port to the VLAN used for voice.\n",
      "With this feature, the LAN infrastructure can distinguish a phone from a PC and does not require manual configuration every time a phone is added, moved, or removed.\n",
      "•Wireless—Cisco wireless access points allow Cisco wireless phone users to roam a campus without losing voice connectivity.\n",
      "If a user roams to a different site, the system will discover the new physical location for emergency 911 information purposes.\n",
      "•Power over Ethernet (POE)—Eliminates the need for local power connections for every phone.\n",
      "Cisco switches can be configured with redundant power supplies connected to uninterruptible power supplies in a data center to ensure that the power to the phone is preserved, even when local power for other equipment at the desk is lost.\n",
      "Most Cisco Unified IP Phone models support the industry-standard 802.3af power and the Cisco pre-standard inline power.\n",
