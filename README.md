# NetBERT ðŸ“¶

**A BERT model pre-trained on a huge corpus of computer networking text (~23Gb)**.

## Usage
You can use NetBERT with [ðŸ¤— transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers):

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForMaskedLM

# Load pretrained model and tokenizer
model = BertForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("antoiloui/netbert")
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("antoiloui/netbert")
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation on the pre-trained model, its implementation, and the data can be found [here](docs/index.md).
